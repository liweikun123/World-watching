| - Look at this map of the most disputed water in the world. It's a sea that is claimed in part by seven countries. | - 看看这张世界上最具争议的水域地图。它是一个部分被七个国家声称的海域。 |
| - [Reporter 1] Tensions are rising in one of the most hotly contested regions on the planet, the South China Sea. | - [记者1] 紧张局势正在升级 在地球上最具争议的地区之一， 南中国海。 |
| - Including one that no one likes to talk about. This sea is peppered with tiny islands, most of which look like this. Small rocks and sunken reefs. But even still, the countries here fight over these little rocks. They build bases on them. They create new islands where there were none. And today I wanna show you why? Specifically, why China claims all of this ocean as theirs, basically the entire South China Sea. I'm gonna show you what China hopes to gain from this claim, both resources and strategic territory. But perhaps more importantly, I wanna show you the story that China tells its people and the world about this water. | - 包括一个没有人喜欢谈论的国家。 这个海域散布着小岛屿， 大多数看起来像这样。 小岩石和沉没的礁石。 但即便如此， 这里的各国仍在为这些小岩石争斗。 他们在上面建造基地。 他们在原本没有岛屿的地方创造新岛屿。 今天我想向你展示为什么？ 具体来说，为什么中国声称所有这片海洋是他们的， 基本上是整个南中国海。 我要向你展示中国希望从这个声称中获得什么， 既包括资源，也包括战略领土。 但也许更重要的是， 我想向你展示中国向其人民 和世界讲述的关于这片水域的故事。 |
| - [Reporter 2] Chinese construction crews have been dumping massive amounts of white sand in seven spots of the South China Sea. | - [记者2] 中国建筑队 已经在南中国海的七个地点倾倒大量白色沙子。 |
| - So this is the backstory of the South China Sea and it's part one of a two-part series. The first piece is this one that you're watching right now, and the second one is the modern conflict of the South China Sea that is currently heating up. That video is live right now on our second channel "Search Party." | - 所以这是南中国海的背景故事 它是两部分系列的第一部分。 第一部分就是你现在正在观看的这个， 第二部分是南中国海的现代冲突 目前正在升温。 那个视频现在已经在我们的第二个频道“Search Party”上线。 |

## The Story of the Islands / 岛屿的故事

| English Original | Chinese Translation |
|------------------|---------------------|
| So to understand how we got here, you have to rewind, to look at maps from hundreds of years ago. Like this one. Here she is. I mean, there's something about seeing it on paper that just never gets old for me. So this map was commissioned by a wealthy Chinese merchant in around the early 1600s, maybe earlier, according to some experts. It's the South China Sea, the map we've been looking at so far in this video, and it's mapped in surprisingly accurate detail. | 所以要理解我们是如何走到这一步的，你必须倒带， 看看数百年前的地图。 像这个。 这里是它。 我是说，在纸上看到它 对我来说永远不会过时。 所以这张地图是由 一个富有的中国商人委托制作的 大约在1600年代早期， 也许更早，根据一些专家的说法。 这是南中国海， 我们在视频中到目前为止一直在看的地图， 它以惊人的准确细节绘制。 |
| - It's an absolutely fascinating map because it does show in great deal trading routes from the eastern Chinese coast all the way down to through Southeast Asia. | - 这是一张绝对引人注目的地图 因为它确实详细展示了贸易路线 从中国东部海岸 一直向下穿过东南亚。 |
| - Bill Hayton is a journalist and academic who has studied the origins of China's claim in the South China Sea. He's been walking me through documents and maps that piece together the story of how China got this U-shaped line. At the time, China was a big powerful civilization. They were a seafaring culture. They used the ocean for trade, and this map is kind of proof of that. You can see all these trade routes, these lines here that go off into Southeast Asia, Indonesia, and off to the Indian Ocean. And importantly, this map shows a bunch of these islands here in the South China Sea. These are very important island groups. And soon you will understand why it is so important that in this map from the 1600s, a Chinese merchant is mapping these islands. I'm gonna put this back now. (map rustling) | - 比尔·海顿是一位记者和学者 他研究了中国在南中国海声称的起源。 他一直在引导我浏览文件 和地图，这些文件和地图拼凑出了中国如何得到这个U形线故事。 当时，中国是一个强大文明。 他们是一个航海文化。 他们使用海洋进行贸易， 这张地图就是证明。 你可以看到所有这些贸易路线， 这些线延伸到东南亚、 印度尼西亚， 以及印度洋。 重要的是， 这张地图展示了南中国海中的一群岛屿。 这些是非常重要的岛群。 很快你就会明白为什么在1600年代的这张地图中， 一个中国商人绘制这些岛屿如此重要。 我现在要把它放回去。 （地图沙沙声） |
| So Chinese merchants and explorers knew about these islands. No one lived on them, but they would stop over when the weather got bad. They would fish around them. Archeologists have found Chinese pottery, bowls and coins on these islands. But back then the Chinese empire didn't care about claiming these islands. There was no sense that they would have any value. They were just some rocks in the middle of the ocean. | 所以中国商人和探险家知道这些岛屿。 没有人住在上面， 但当天气变坏时他们会停留。 他们会在周围捕鱼。 考古学家在这些岛屿上发现了中国陶器、 碗和硬币。 但当时中国帝国并不在意声称这些岛屿。 没有感觉它们有任何价值。 它们只是海洋中的一些岩石。 |
| - This map is good evidence of trading patterns. We have evidence of trading, but we don't have evidence of ownership or occupation because really, nobody cared about such things. | - 这张地图是贸易模式的良好证据。 我们有贸易的证据， 但我们没有所有权或占领的证据 因为真的，没有人关心这样的事情。 |
| - That is until the French arrived to Southeast Asia. You didn't think I was gonna make it this far without talking about Europeans claiming land, right? Setting the stage for modern conflicts. | - 直到法国人抵达东南亚。 你没想到我会走到这一步而不谈欧洲人声称土地，对吧？ 为现代冲突铺设舞台。 |
| - Its navy starts to colonize what it calls Indochina, what's now Vietnam. And that, of course, brings them into direct conflict with China. | - 它的海军开始殖民它称为印度支那的地方， 现在是越南。 当然，这让他们与中国直接冲突。 |
| - [Johnny] So it's the 1930s and France has claimed ownership over these islands, which angers China and Japan. These islands, this water, has started to become more strategic to these growing empires. | - [约翰尼] 所以是1930年代 法国声称对这些岛屿的所有权， 这激怒了中国和日本。 这些岛屿，这片水域， 开始对这些成长中的帝国变得更具战略性。 |
| - So then a lot of the strategic thinkers in Britain and Paris and the US are thinking about who's gonna control these little islands in the South China Sea and what does it mean? | - 所以当时英国、巴黎和美国的许多战略思想家 都在思考谁将控制 南中国海中的这些小岛屿 以及这意味着什么？ |
| - [Johnny] Especially Japan who had followed the example of European empires and started growing an empire of their own. By the late 1930s, Japan starts rapidly taking over this whole region, including a lot of these islands in the South China Sea. | - [约翰尼] 尤其是日本，他们效仿欧洲帝国的例子 并开始发展自己的帝国。 到1930年代晚期， 日本开始迅速接管整个地区， 包括南中国海中的许多岛屿。 |
| - Japanese have started surveys and thinking, "Well, we can use this for a seaplane harbor or a submarine dock or something like that. During the Second World War, I mean, the South China Sea basically becomes a Japanese lake. So for the first time in history, one power controls almost the whole of the coast, of the South China Sea. | - 日本人开始调查并思考， “嗯，我们可以用这个作为水上飞机港 或潜艇码头之类的东西。 在第二次世界大战期间， 我是说，南中国海 基本上成为一个日本湖。 所以历史上第一次， 一个大国控制了几乎 南中国海的整个海岸。 |
| - Eventually the US would enter World War II and beat back Japan, forcing them to give up control of all of this territory that it had conquered during the war, including all of these islands in the South China Sea. (bright music) (waves crashing) | - 最终美国将进入第二次世界大战 并击退日本， 迫使他们放弃控制 战争期间征服的所有领土， 包括南中国海中的所有这些岛屿。 （明亮的音乐） （海浪撞击声） |

## The Scramble / 争夺

| English Original | Chinese Translation |
|------------------|---------------------|
| World War II made it clear that all of these rocky islands were suddenly important. They were strategic locations at a very important crossroads in the world. It also made it clear that if your country doesn't claim them, someone else will. So we have a bit of a scramble for all these islands. China, of course, thinks that most of this is theirs. Remember the maps and the pottery? Vietnam, who's going through an independence movement is split in two, but the south comes out and says a lot of these islands are close to Vietnam. Not to mention their former colonizer, France, formally claimed them, so they should belong to Vietnam. The Philippines is busy establishing its newly independent country, so it doesn't claim any of these islands at first. But strangely, one Filipino businessman goes out to a cluster of 53 islands and claims that he discovered them and he declares his own country called, wait for it... The Free Territory of Freedomland. (chuckles) That name. Now this Filipino businessman only occupied these islands for like 90 days, but his claim technically lasted like a couple decades before eventually, the Filipino government forced him to give it up. They actually tried to use his claim to say that, that these islands belong to the Philippines. I mean, you can see how difficult this is getting. There are hundreds of little, tiny islands scattered throughout the South China Sea. They weren't that important for many centuries, and suddenly they became very important all at once. But now let me show you the map that will change everything. This is perhaps the biggest moment in the history of the South China Sea. Hold on a sec. (suspenseful music) Wait, actually before I do, I should pause and thank to the sponsor of today's video because it actually has a lot to do with my goal for this video, which is I'm trying to give an alternative view of the South China Sea. Something different than what you normally see. Here in the United States, I mostly consume Western media, which makes getting a truly global perspective difficult. And that's because this is a really polarizing issue, it's very political, which is why I have been a long time subscriber of "Ground News." I am a massive fan of this service. Their website and app feeds in over 50,000 sources of news, which is why I use it daily, not just on my channel but across all of our channels. And the reason why is because it allows us to filter the coverage based on political bias, location, based on factuality. This saves me so much time because I can instantly compare how different outlets are covering a topic. As I was reporting this story on the South China Sea, I went to "Ground News" and came upon this headline from "Rappler," which is a Filipino outlet. See how the headline emphasizes China's presence in their water as illegal? Whereas, if you look at this Chinese controlled outlet called the "Global Times," you'll see that this newspaper calls the Filipino allegations malicious hype and attacks the Philippines for their smear campaign. Now, if you were just reading these websites and didn't know, like, who they were owned by or influenced by, it would be so much harder to sniff out the bias present in these headlines. But here I have them sitting side by side. This is incredibly valuable for people who want to be critical thinkers. Okay, but it's important to note that media discrepancy isn't just happening in Asia, it's happening here in the US as well. The new Trump presidency is gonna have massive impacts on how the South China Sea plays out, and different outlets are gonna have different takes on that, which is why I'm relying on "Ground News" to track all of these developments, the different biases that are present, and to also help me reveal my biases and blind spots, which is one of the features on "Ground News." They help me quickly see what is being reported? How it's being framed? Who's funding these different outlets? All of this information that I can't really see anywhere else. I've been using their Vantage plan for all of these benefits and I've been using it for a while now. And you can too, for almost half the price. If you use the link in my description, it's ground.news/johnnyharris, or scan this beautiful QR code that is on screen, you'll get 40% off the Vantage plan so you can start using all of these features. All in, you're looking at, like, five bucks a month for this. I can't emphasize enough how much this tool aligns with what I'm trying to do here on the channel, which is promote transparency, fairness, critical thinking, curiosity and awareness of our biases. Thank you "Ground News" for existing and for sponsoring today's video. Check out that link if you're interested. And now I'm gonna go get that map (intense music) So here it is. Let's go back up to China really quick. And there's actually not just one China. There are two. And look at this moment, it's right after World War II, so it's like the late 1940s. There's the nationalist government, the Republic of China is what it's called. They're like the main government of China. But then there is a communist revolution, a bunch of revolutionaries that are fighting to overthrow the government. It's a civil war, but even during this civil war, the Republic of China, the nationalists, aren't gonna let all these other countries take over these islands. So they send their navy out to some of the largest islands in these groups, and these ships show up to these islands basically saying we're gonna claim these for China. Oh, and little side note here, guess where they got these naval ships from the United States of America. Who gave them to the Republic of China to support them because they were fighting communists, but they're using these ships to claim islands in the South China Sea. | 第二次世界大战清楚地表明 所有这些岩石岛屿突然变得重要。 它们是世界上非常重要十字路口的战略位置。 它也清楚地表明 如果你的国家不声称它们，其他人会。 所以我们对所有这些岛屿有点争夺。 中国当然认为大多数是他们的。 记得地图和陶器吗？ 越南，正在经历独立运动 被分裂成两个， 但南方出来说 许多这些岛屿靠近越南。 更不用说他们的前殖民者法国， 正式声称它们， 所以它们应该属于越南。 菲律宾忙于建立 其新独立的国家， 所以一开始它没有声称任何这些岛屿。 但奇怪的是，一个菲律宾商人 出去到一个53个岛屿的集群 并声称他发现了它们 他宣布自己的国家叫， 等一下... 自由领土自由地。 （笑）那个名字。 现在这个菲律宾商人 只占领这些岛屿大约90天， 但他的声称技术上持续了几个十年 直到最终，菲律宾政府 迫使他放弃。 他们实际上试图使用他的声称来说， 这些岛屿属于菲律宾。 我的意思是，你可以看到这变得多么困难。 南中国海散布着数百个小小岛屿。 它们在许多世纪并不那么重要， 突然它们一下子变得非常重要。 但现在让我向你展示将改变一切的地图。 这可能是南中国海历史上最大的时刻。 等一下。 （悬念音乐） 等一下，实际上在做之前， 我应该暂停并感谢今天视频的赞助商 因为它实际上与我这个视频的目标有很大关系， 那就是我试图给出 南中国海的替代观点。 不同于你通常看到的。 在美国这里， 我主要消费西方媒体， 这使得获得真正全球视角困难。 那是因为这是一个真正两极分化的问题， 它非常政治， 这就是为什么我一直是“Ground News”的长期订阅者。 我是这个服务的超级粉丝。 他们的网站和应用程序输入超过50,000个新闻来源， 这就是为什么我每天使用它， 不仅仅在我的频道而在我们所有频道。 原因是它允许我们基于政治偏见、位置、 基于事实性过滤覆盖。 这节省了我这么多时间 因为我可以立即比较 不同媒体如何报道一个话题。 当我报道南中国海的故事时， 我去了“Ground News” 并看到了来自“Rappler”的这个标题， 这是菲律宾媒体。 看看标题如何强调中国在他们水域的存在是非法的？ 而如果你看这个中国控制的媒体 叫“Global Times”， 你会看到这个报纸 称菲律宾的指控为恶意炒作 并攻击菲律宾的诽谤运动。 现在，如果你只是阅读这些网站 而不知道，比如， 谁拥有它们或受谁影响， 嗅出这些标题中的偏见会困难得多。 但在这里我让他们并排坐着。 这对想要成为批判性思考者的人来说 非常有价值。 好的，但重要的是要注意 媒体差异不仅仅发生在亚洲， 它也在美国这里发生。 新特朗普总统职位将对南中国海的发展产生巨大影响， 不同媒体将有不同的看法， 这就是为什么我依赖“Ground News” 来跟踪所有这些发展， 存在的不同偏见， 以及帮助我揭示我的偏见和盲点， 这是“Ground News”上的一个功能。 他们帮助我快速看到什么被报道？ 它如何被框架？ 谁资助这些不同媒体？ 所有这些信息 我在其他地方真的看不到。 我一直在使用他们的Vantage计划 获得所有这些好处 我已经使用它一段时间了。 你也可以，以几乎一半的价格。 如果你使用我描述中的链接， 它是ground.news/johnnyharris， 或扫描屏幕上的这个美丽QR码， 你将获得Vantage计划40%的折扣 所以你可以开始使用所有这些功能。 总的来说，你每月只需5美元左右。 我不能足够强调 这个工具如何与我在频道上试图做的对齐， 那就是促进透明、公平、批判性思考、 好奇心和对我们偏见的意识。 感谢“Ground News”存在 并赞助今天的视频。 如果你感兴趣，请查看那个链接。 现在我要去拿那张地图 （激烈音乐） 所以这里是它。 让我们快速回到中国。 实际上不仅仅有一个中国。有两个。 看看这个时刻， 它就在第二次世界大战之后， 所以像1940年代晚期。 有国民党政府， 叫中华民国。 他们像是中国的主要政府。 但然后有共产主义革命， 一群革命者 正在争取推翻政府。 这是一场内战，但即使在内战期间， 中华民国，国民党， 不会让所有其他国家 接管这些岛屿。 所以他们派出海军 到这些群体中一些最大的岛屿， 这些船只出现在这些岛屿 基本上说我们要为中国声称这些。 哦，这里有个小旁注， 猜猜他们从哪里得到这些海军舰艇 从美利坚合众国。 谁给了中华民国支持他们 因为他们在与共产主义者作战， 但他们使用这些船只 来声称南中国海中的岛屿。 |
| - And so the 12th of December 1946 is the first time that any Chinese official goes to a Spratly Island and sticks a flag in it. Nobody ever lives there permanently, but people go and sort of stick a flag, and then the other guy comes and pulls the flag out, sticks their own flag there. (intense music) | - 所以1946年12月12日是第一次 任何中国官员去斯普拉特利岛 并插一面旗帜。 没有人永久居住在那里， 但人们去并插一面旗帜， 然后另一个人来拔出旗帜， 插上自己的旗帜。 （激烈音乐） |
| - And then, they release this map. Take a look. (inquisitive music) This is the official map where they claim what they say is their water in the South China Sea. It's made up of these dashes, 11-dashes to be precise. Drawn around the periphery of the entire South China Sea. This map is basically saying, "Hey guys, this water has always been ours and remains ours. Stay back. Now that Japan is defeated, we are going to formally assert that this water is ours as it always has been." This is the most important map and the most important moment in this history. I've always been mesmerized by the sort of ambiguity and ambition of this line, and I don't have a solid theory as to the motives of the people who decided to draw it and what they were after. And again, especially in the context of a divided nationalist government that is being hounded by communist revolutionaries and soon about to lose a war, and yet they make time to draw a map and release it to the world. What's going on here? | - 然后，他们发布了这个地图。看看。 （好奇音乐） 这是官方地图 他们声称他们所说的他们在南中国海的水域。 它由这些虚线组成，精确地说11条虚线。 围绕整个南中国海的外围绘制。 这个地图基本上在说， “嘿伙计们，这片水域一直是我们 的并仍然是我们 的。 退后。 现在日本被击败了， 我们将正式断言 这片水域是我们 的就像一直以来一样。” 这是这个历史上最重要的地图 和最重要的时刻。 我一直被这条线的某种模糊性和雄心所迷住， 我没有一个坚实的理论 关于决定绘制它的人的动机 和他们追求什么。 再次，尤其在分裂的国民党政府 的背景下 被共产主义革命者追逐 并很快将输掉战争， 然而他们抽时间绘制一张地图 并发布给世界。 这里发生了什么？ |
| - So at the end of the second World War, you still had a country which didn't really, you know, defined its boundaries. And so they called upon geography professors in 1946, specifically with regard to the sea, to try and work out which islands China was going to claim. And go back to this old Atlas of 1936, and they say, "This is where the line should be." (waves crashing) | - 所以在第二次世界大战结束时， 你仍然有一个国家没有真正， 你知道，定义其边界。 所以他们在1946年召集地理教授， 特别是关于海洋， 试图弄清楚中国将声称哪些岛屿。 并回到1936年的这个旧地图集， 他们说，“这就是线应该在哪里。” （海浪撞击声） |

## Republic to People’s Republic / 从共和国到人民共和国

| English Original | Chinese Translation |
|------------------|---------------------|
| - Okay, back up to China where there's a civil war happening and one side is winning, the communists, led by Mao Zedong, and the Republic of China is fleeing looking for safety. It's their government, their military, and their civilian followers. Millions of people all running away from the communists. And they end up here at these 180 kilometers straight where they cross it to this Chinese island of Taiwan. They were safe here. The communists couldn't cross this strait because their navy and air force weren't strong enough. Plus, they figured that the US would come to their defense. So now we still have these two Chinas both claiming to be the real China and who both hate each other. Okay, back to the South China Sea. What did Mao Zedong do with this South China Sea after he took over mainland China? Well, he adopted the same map that the Republic of China had drawn this 11-dash line that encompasses the whole sea. So now you have both of these Chinas, China and Taiwan both claiming the same body of water. And this big claim overlaps with the claims coming in from all these other countries. So this is our context. This is how we got here. China feels entitled to all of this water. They draw an 11-dash line, they split into two Chinas who both claim this 11-dash line, and it's like 1950 or something. Now, a few years later, the mainland China, the communists, did remove two of these dashes from the 11-dash line. They gave up an island and some water back to North Vietnam as a gesture of friendship to their communist comrades. So now mainland China has a nine dash line and the Republic of China, Taiwan, has an 11-dash line. I mean, this is getting weird. As the 20th century progresses, the scramble continues as countries start backing up their claims with military might, trying to establish a physical presence on the islands that they claim. So Taiwan sends their troops back to Taiping Island, which they still hold today, and things start heating up even more when the global economy starts to come online and we realize that this water is along critical shipping lanes, it's good water for fishing, and it is strategically placed militarily. And then in the late 1960s, they discover oil in the South China Sea. And once again, the race is on. | - 好的，回到中国 那里正在发生内战 一方正在获胜，共产主义者， 由毛泽东领导， 中华民国正在逃亡寻找安全。 这是他们的政府，他们的军队， 和他们的平民追随者。 数百万人都在逃离共产主义者。 他们最终在这里的180公里海峡 跨越它到这个中国岛屿台湾。 他们在这里安全。 共产主义者无法跨越这个海峡 因为他们的海军和空军不够强大。 另外，他们认为美国会来防御他们。 所以现在我们仍然有两个中国 都声称自己是真正的中国 并且彼此仇恨。 好的，回到南中国海。 毛泽东在接管中国大陆后 对这个南中国海做了什么？ 嗯，他采用了中华民国绘制的同一张地图 这个11虚线包围整个海域。 所以现在你有两个中国， 中国和台湾都声称同一片水域。 这个大声称 与来自所有其他国家的声称重叠。 所以这是我们的上下文。 这就是我们如何走到这里。 中国觉得有权拥有所有这片水域。 他们绘制一个11虚线， 他们分裂成两个中国都声称这个11虚线， 就像1950年左右。 现在，几年后， 中国大陆，共产主义者， 确实从11虚线中移除了两条虚线。 他们放弃了一个岛屿 和一些水域回给北越南 作为对他们的共产主义同志的友谊姿态。 所以现在中国大陆有一个九虚线 而中华民国，台湾，有一个11虚线。 我的意思是，这变得奇怪了。 随着20世纪的进展， 争夺继续 因为国家开始用军事力量支持他们的声称， 试图在他们声称的岛屿上建立物理存在。 所以台湾派他们的部队回到太平岛， 他们今天仍然持有， 事情开始更加升温 当全球经济开始上线 我们意识到这片水域 沿着关键航运通道， 它是捕鱼的好水域， 并且在军事上战略放置。 然后在1960年代晚期， 他们在南中国海发现了石油。 再次，竞赛开始了。 |
| - So it's a kind of, you know, all of these emerging nation states standing up and standing proud, really. | - 所以这是一种，你知道， 所有这些新兴民族国家 站起来并自豪，真的。 |
| - South Vietnam tries to make good on its claim in the Spratly Islands by sending settlers to claim the islands and working with foreign oil companies to start drilling. China starts drilling too in the Paracels. A lot of Chinese fishermen are also down here and south Vietnam doesn't like this. So they send their army to kick these fishermen out. China doesn't take kindly to this. And so they then send six naval vessels and two support jets to fight the South Vietnamese, taking full control of these islands and getting into a clash that kills 70 Vietnamese troops. And once they do this, China decides they don't wanna leave. So they start setting up more infrastructure on these islands, having a permanent presence and controlling them completely. Over the years, the islands start filling up with more and more military bases and outposts. It becomes a crowded neighborhood where everyone is fighting for a slice of oil or shipping lanes, minerals, or just a strategic military location. Needless to say, this way of doing things is not a great way to solve territorial disputes in the water. Like whoever shows up first and puts their little push pin on the map, it's not a way to avoid conflict. Luckily, the law of the sea was just around the corner. | - 南越南试图兑现其在斯普拉特利群岛的声称 通过派遣定居者声称岛屿 并与外国石油公司合作开始钻探。 中国也在帕拉塞尔群岛开始钻探。 许多中国渔民也在这里 南越南不喜欢这个。 所以他们派军队踢出这些渔民。 中国对此不友好。 所以他们然后派六艘海军舰艇 和两架支持喷气机与南越作战， 完全控制这些岛屿 并进入一场杀死70名越南部队的冲突。 一旦他们这样做，中国决定他们不想离开。 所以他们开始在这些岛屿上设置更多基础设施， 有永久存在并完全控制它们。 多年来， 岛屿开始填满越来越多军事基地和前哨。 它成为一个拥挤的邻里 每个人都在为石油或航运通道、矿物、 或只是战略军事位置的一片而战。 不用说， 这种做事方式不是解决水域领土争端的好方法。 就像谁先出现并在地图上放他们的小推针， 这不是避免冲突的方法。 幸运的是，海洋法就在拐角处。 |

## Constitution of the Ocean / 海洋宪法

| English Original | Chinese Translation |
|------------------|---------------------|
| So while all these countries were fighting over the South China Sea, the international community was working on solving the problem of how to determine what country gets what water. The world was getting better at finding valuable resources in the deep ocean and we really needed rules on who owned what. | 所以当所有这些国家 为南中国海而战时， 国际社会正在努力解决 如何确定哪个国家得到什么水域的问题。 世界在深海找到宝贵资源方面变得更好 我们真的需要关于谁拥有什么的规则。 |
| - Communist China takes part in the discussions on the law of the sea as a full member. And so therefore, it's kind of a... If you like, represents something that they agreed to. So in theory, it's bound by the rules of UNCLOS which say that, you know, you can claim territorial sea of 12 nautical miles. You can then make a resource claim that goes up to 200 nautical miles. But that doesn't really fit with the U-shaped line claim. | - 共产主义中国作为正式成员 参与海洋法的讨论。 所以因此，这有点... 如果你喜欢，代表他们同意的东西。 所以理论上，它受UNCLOS规则约束 这些规则说，你知道， 你可以声称12海里的领海。 你然后可以做出资源声称 达到200海里。 但这并不真正适合U形线声称。 |
| - And almost every country on earth agreed to this. They ratified UNCLOS except for one big exception, the United States of America. Yes, the United States, while they do follow the norms of UNCLOS have not ratified it, which is kind of a trend with the US. Like they want to preserve the global order, but they don't want to necessarily agree to all of the laws because they don't like to be constrained. (waves crashing) (gentle music) | - 地球上几乎每个国家都同意这个。 他们批准了UNCLOS除了一个大例外， 美利坚合众国。 是的，美国， 虽然他们遵循UNCLOS的规范 但没有批准它， 这有点是美国的趋势。 就像他们想维护全球秩序， 但他们不想必然同意所有法律 因为他们不喜欢被约束。 （海浪撞击声） （温柔音乐） |

## Today / 今天

| English Original | Chinese Translation |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Back to the South China Sea, UNCLOS was supposed to create order, create a framework, through which all these countries can make their claims and work things out peaceably. But that didn't happen. In fact, the whole 200 nautical mile rule incentivized countries to try to claim these little islands because if you claim this little island, you get 200 nautical miles off of that island, so countries continue to build things on these islands, especially China, who's built all sorts of military bases and has even resorted to building new islands where there were none, which like someday I want to go there and see what that looks like. Like I've seen it from above these satellite photos of how they're dredging up all of this sand and putting it on these reefs, but it just never made sense to me how they can build islands. (gentle music) | 回到南中国海， UNCLOS本应该创造秩序， 创造一个框架， 通过它所有这些国家可以做出他们的声称 并和平解决问题。 但那没有发生。 事实上，整个200海里规则 激励国家试图声称这些小岛屿 因为如果你声称这个小岛屿， 你得到那个岛屿外200海里， 所以国家继续在这些岛屿上建造东西， 尤其是中国，谁建造了各种军事基地 甚至诉诸于在没有的地方建造新岛屿， 就像有一天我想去那里 看看它看起来像什么。 就像我从上面这些卫星照片看到 他们如何挖起所有这些沙子 并放在这些礁石上， 但它对我来说从来没有意义 他们如何能建造岛屿。 （温柔音乐） |
| - And so now China has then sort of said, well, we're not just talking about one island, we're talking about groups of islands. And if they're a group of island, could we draw a line around the whole group of islands, and then claim from there? And everyone else is saying, "No, that's not what it says in the text." | - 所以现在中国然后有点说， 嗯，我们不仅仅在谈一个岛屿， 我们谈的是岛群。 如果它们是一个岛群， 我们能在整个岛群周围绘制一条线， 然后从那里声称？ 而其他人都在说， “不，那不是文本中说的。” |
| - China continues to this day to claim the nine dash line as their official claim to the South China Sea. And by the way, so does Taiwan though they claim the 11-dash line. We don't hear about that much. In 2016, the Philippines sued China in the International Court of Arbitration saying that China was violating UNCLOS and infringing in the Filipino EEZ with their nine dash line. China declined to participate in these proceedings saying that the court had no jurisdiction to rule in what they view as Chinese waters. But the court proceeded and came out with a ruling that said that China's nine dash line was totally illegal or lawless in their words. | - 中国到今天继续声称九虚线 作为他们对南中国海的官方声称。 顺便说一下，台湾也这样虽然他们声称11虚线。 我们没有听到那么多。 在2016年， 菲律宾在国际仲裁法院起诉中国 说中国违反UNCLOS 并用他们的九虚线侵犯菲律宾EEZ。 中国拒绝参与这些程序 说法院没有管辖权 在他们视为中国水域的地方裁决。 但法院继续 并得出一个裁决说 中国的九虚线 完全非法或用他们的话说无法无天。 |
| - Yeah, I think it's significant that China isn't just saying, "It's ours, go away. We've got a bigger Navy than you." It is also saying what we're doing is legal, but other countries don't accept the legal arguments. | - 是的，我认为重要的是 中国不仅仅在说，“这是我们的，走开。 我们有比你更大的海军。” 它也在说什么我们做的 是合法的，但其他国家不接受法律论点。 |
| - I'm looking at the legal rebuttal from the Chinese government during this tribunal. And it basically tells the story we've just laid out here in this video. The Chinese activities in South China Sea date back over 2,000 years, China was the first country to discover, name, explore, and exploit the resources of the South China Sea Islands and the first to continuously exercise sovereign powers over them. And they talk about how in the 30s and 40s, foreigners, especially Japan, illegally seized some parts of the South China Sea. There were some wars. And then after World War II, the Chinese government resumed exercising its sovereignty over the South China Sea. And that all of these acts affirm China's territorial sovereignty and relevant maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea. This history is core to their claim. | - 我正在看中国政府在这个法庭期间的法律反驳。 它基本上讲述了我们在这个视频中刚刚阐述的故事。 中国在南中国海的活动 可以追溯到2000多年前， 中国是第一个发现、命名、探索、 并开发南中国海岛屿资源的国家 并且是第一个持续行使 主权权力的国家。 他们谈论如何在30年代和40年代， 外国人，尤其是日本， 非法夺取南中国海的一些部分。 有一些战争。 然后在第二次世界大战后， 中国政府恢复行使其对南中国海的主权。 所有这些行为 肯定了中国的领土主权 和相关的海洋权利 和南中国海的利益。 这个历史是他们声称的核心。 |
| - At the bottom, it's an argument over who owns each individual rock and reef. And China, you know, has a good claim to being the first country to have stuck a flag in certain, you know, rocks or reefs and then maintained a presence there. | - 归根结底，这是关于谁拥有 每个个别岩石和礁石的争论。 中国，你知道，有一个好声称 是第一个在某些，你知道，岩石或礁石插旗的国家 然后在那里维持存在。 |
| - Okay, I understand the argument now that we've gone through the history, but if maps, pottery, fishing activity all thousands of years ago is what you need to make a modern day maritime claim, then other countries like Vietnam and even the Philippines would have a similar claim. One thing I've learned is that the time machine game of who got here first is not a useful way to settle border disputes, it's just not. You can always go back further. But even still, China continues to assert this nine dash line even as it causes major tension with almost all their neighbors. And this gets to a really important aspect of this water. It's the reason we started this video showing you all of those old maps, that pottery. (suspenseful music) | - 好的，现在我们经历了历史，我理解了论点， 但如果地图、陶器、 数千年前的捕鱼活动 是你需要做出现代海洋声称的东西， 那么其他国家如越南 甚至菲律宾会有类似的声称。 我学到的一件事是 谁先到这里的时光机游戏 不是解决边境争端的有效方式，它不是。 你总是可以追溯更远。 但即便如此，中国继续断言 这个九虚线 即使它与几乎所有邻国造成重大紧张。 这涉及到这片水域的一个非常重要的方面。 这就是我们开始这个视频向你展示所有那些旧地图的原因， 那个陶器。 （悬念音乐） |
