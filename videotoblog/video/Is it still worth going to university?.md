Is it still worth going to university?

Earning a degree used to lead to a steady job with a good salary. But today young graduates in the West are finding fewer employment opportunities. So, is it still worth going to university?

Are you more likely to be employed if you’re a graduate?

The unemployment rate of young graduates in America is now approaching the same rate for the age group as a whole. In 2010 there was around a six percentage-point difference in unemployment between young people and young graduates. But now there's just a one percentage-point difference between them.

It's not just in America. In the European Union the unemployment rate of young people with tertiary education is now approaching the overall rate for that age group.

One theory for this is that universities are accepting less-talented applicants, and then they aren't teaching them very well. This could lead to employers not expecting much of a difference between the average graduate and then someone who didn't go to university.

Another theory is that fewer jobs need graduate-level qualifications. For example, in the past you often needed to attend a university in order to understand how to use a computer. On the frontiers of science the strange world of the computer. But today almost everyone can use tech, regardless of whether or not they went to university.

The number of jobs in graduate-friendly industries is also decreasing. Across the EU the number of 15-to-24-year olds who are employed in finance and insurance fell by 16% from 2009-2024. And, since 2016, the number of British twentysomethings in law and finance has fallen by 10%.

It's tempting to blame AI for these waning opportunities. Yet the decline in graduate jobs started long before ChatGPT. What's more likely is that the industries that traditionally employed graduates have had a tough time lately. Since the global financial crisis of 2007-2009, the golden age of investment banking is over, so they're spending less money on hiring graduates.

Are people still applying to university?

In America all this is affecting young people's decision on whether or not to attend college. The number of Americans enrolled in bachelor's programmes fell by 5% from 2013-2022, according to data from the OECD. Yet in most rich countries, where education is cheaper because the state plays a larger role, young people are still applying to universities in droves. Excluding America, enrolment across the OECD rose from 28m to 31m in the decade to 2022.

Perhaps students simply aren't picking the right subjects. Arts, humanities and social sciences are still proving popular. Even, inexplicably, journalism. If these trends say anything about young people's ideas about the future of work, they truly are in trouble.

How will AI impact jobs?

So, in the age of AI what should you study at university?

As technology improves, the future of work is changing, too. Many of the jobs that graduates will have don't even exist yet. Some young people worry that certain skills they learn might become outdated as technology changes. Coding, for example, is at risk of becoming obsolete within only a few years. According to one study the percentage of American and British IT professionals who worry that AI tools will make many of their day-to-day skills obsolete increased from 74% to 91% in just one year.

There are some subjects which are likely to stay relevant. Robotics, for example, will help people maximise the benefits of technological change. And practical jobs, like plumbing and carpentry, are less likely to be taken over by AI and will remain valued by society. These professions often don't require a university qualification and can be learnt in other ways, like on apprenticeships.

What should you study in the age of AI?

But arguably what's more important for students than studying a specific subject is to focus on learning soft skills instead. Things like communication, critical thinking and reliability, as well as empathy and being able to build relationships. All are transferable across multiple industries.

OECD findings from 2019 demonstrate that people will need to rely on their currently unique human skills to succeed. Understanding how to learn will be key to developing new skills and adapting in changing times. The research also suggests that jobs with complex social interactions, such as care, will still need humans so developing skills like negotiation and persuasion will be vital.

Currently AI isn't very good at these soft skills. I understand emotions have a deep meaning, but I can't experience them like you can. So if workers can plug the gaps, while also being able to transition into emerging industries, then it will help humans to compete with machines.

Nearly all degrees will allow you to gain these skills through group projects, presentations and extra-curricular activities.

The importance of work experience

Ultimately it doesn't really matter which degree you choose to study. Perhaps what's even more important is that a student gains work experience or an internship. Research finds that those who graduated in 2022 and completed internships were 23% more likely to start a full-time position within six months of graduation. This gap increases further in certain fields, like oil, gas and mining, where it rose to 65%.

Although it's hard to predict how improving technology will change the world of work over the coming decades, one thing is for sure: a student with a variety of skills, a lifelong desire to learn and a good attitude will go far.

上大学还值得吗？

获得学位曾经能通往一份稳定的工作和不错的薪水。但如今，西方的年轻毕业生发现就业机会越来越少。那么，上大学还值得吗？

如果你是毕业生，就业几率更高吗？

美国年轻毕业生的失业率现在正接近同龄群体整体的失业率。2010年，年轻人和年轻毕业生之间的失业率差距约为6个百分点。但现在，它们之间只有1个百分点的差距。

这不仅仅发生在美国。在欧盟，受过高等教育的年轻人的失业率现在正接近该年龄群体的整体水平。

一种理论认为，这是因为大学在招收能力较差的申请者，然后又没有好好教他们。这可能导致雇主不期待普通毕业生与未上大学的人之间有太大区别。

另一种理论是，需要大学学历的职位越来越少。例如，过去你往往需要上大学才能学会使用电脑。在科学前沿，电脑这个奇怪的世界。但如今，几乎每个人都能使用科技，无论是否上过大学。

适合毕业生的行业的职位数量也在减少。在欧盟，15至24岁在金融和保险业就业的人数从2009年至2024年下降了16%。而且，自2016年以来，英国二十多岁在法律和金融领域的人数下降了10%。

人们很容易将这些机会减少归咎于AI。然而，毕业生职位的下降早在ChatGPT出现之前就开始了。更可能的是，传统上雇用毕业生的行业最近日子不好过。自2007-2009年全球金融危机以来，投资银行的黄金时代结束了，因此它们在招聘毕业生上的支出减少了。

人们还在申请大学吗？

在美国，这一切正在影响年轻人是否上大学的决定。根据经合组织的数据，从2013年至2022年，美国本科生入学人数下降了5%。然而，在大多数富裕国家，由于国家发挥更大作用，教育费用更低，年轻人仍在蜂拥申请大学。排除美国，经合组织整体入学人数在截至2022年的十年内从2800万上升到3100万。

或许学生们只是没有选对专业。艺术、人文和社会科学仍然很受欢迎。甚至莫名其妙地，新闻学也是。如果这些趋势反映了年轻人对未来工作的想法，那他们真的有麻烦了。

AI将如何影响就业？

那么，在AI时代，你应该在大学学什么？

随着技术进步，工作的未来也在改变。毕业生将从事的许多工作甚至还不存在。有些年轻人担心，他们学到的某些技能可能会随着技术变化而过时。例如，编程有可能在短短几年内变得过时。根据一项研究，美国和英国IT专业人士担心AI工具会使他们许多日常技能过时的比例，在短短一年内从74%上升到91%。

有些专业很可能保持相关性。例如，机器人学将帮助人们最大化技术变革的好处。而实用工作，如管道工和木工，不太可能被AI取代，并将继续受到社会重视。这些职业往往不需要大学学历，可以通过其他方式学习，比如学徒制。

在AI时代，你应该学什么？

但可以说，对学生来说，比学习特定专业更重要的是专注于学习软技能。比如沟通、批判性思维和可靠性，以及同理心和建立关系的能力。这些技能都可以跨多个行业转移。

经合组织2019年的研究表明，人们需要依靠目前独特的人类技能来成功。理解如何学习将是开发新技能和适应变化时代的关键。研究还表明，具有复杂社会互动的工作，如护理，仍将需要人类，因此发展谈判和说服等技能至关重要。

目前AI在这些软技能上表现不佳。我理解情绪有深刻的含义，但我无法像你一样体验它们。因此，如果工人能填补空白，同时还能过渡到新兴行业，这将帮助人类与机器竞争。

几乎所有学位都能让你通过小组项目、演讲和课外活动获得这些技能。

工作经验的重要性

最终，你选择学哪个学位并不重要。或许更重要的是学生获得工作经验或实习。研究发现，2022年毕业并完成实习的学生，在毕业后六个月内开始全职工作的可能性高出23%。在某些领域，如石油、天然气和采矿，这个差距进一步扩大，达到65%。

虽然很难预测技术进步将在未来几十年如何改变工作世界，但有一点是肯定的：一个拥有各种技能、终身学习欲望和良好态度的学生，将走得很远。
