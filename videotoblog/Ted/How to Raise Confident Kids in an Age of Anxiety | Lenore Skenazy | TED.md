### 英文原文 + 中文翻译（两人对话形式）

**W:** You actually start your talk by mentioning that you have been called America's worst mom after you let your nine-year-old ride the New York City subway alone, and you embraced that title. So while maybe not initially, but when you look back at that moment, what do you think struck a cultural nerve?

**L:** So that he’s 27 now, so I’ve been thinking about it for a while. And I think two things struck a nerve… Because I looked at older columns of mine where I had let my kids play in the courtyard without me, I let them take elevators without me, I let them go — they’re two boys — let them go to the men’s room without me obviously, and nobody cared about any of those columns.  
So I think by writing about my kid taking the subway by himself, it was basically “the subway”. Hey, New York City subway does not have a great reputation, and people think it’s hell, and “why would you send your kid down to hell, at least without you?”  
And then I think it wasn’t just me saying “kids need independence.” It was me actually doing it — pedal to the metal — and the fact that he loved it. It wasn’t something that we did because “he should learn, he should be toughened up.” It was just: he wanted to take the subway by himself and we let him. It’s like, “Oh yeah, kids have things that they want to do on their own, and maybe we should listen to them and see what happens.”  
So yeah, I think it’s the subway.

**W（主持人）**：你在一开始就提到，因为你让9岁的儿子独自坐纽约地铁，你被称作“美国最烂的妈妈”，而且你还接受了这个称号。回过头来看那一刻，你觉得是什么触动了文化的神经？

**L（Lenore）**：他现在27岁了，所以我已经想这个问题很久了。我觉得有两点触动了神经……我翻看了以前写的专栏，我让孩子在没有我的情况下在院子里玩、自己坐电梯、两个男孩自己去男厕所，显然没人关心那些文章。  
所以当我写孩子独自坐地铁的时候，关键就在于“地铁”。纽约地铁名声不好，大家觉得那是地狱，“你为什么要把孩子一个人送下去，至少你得陪着啊？”  
而且这不只是我说“孩子需要独立”，而是我真的去做到了——全力以赴——而且他还特别开心。我们不是因为“他该学习独立、该被锻炼”才让他去的，只是他自己想一个人坐地铁，我们就让他坐了。这就像在说：“哦，对哦，孩子有自己想做的事，也许我们该听听他们的，看看会发生什么。”  
所以，对，就是地铁。

**W:** All these years later it’s still something that people are obsessed with. Could you talk a little bit about what exactly “free-range kids” means?

**L:** I knew you were going to ask, and frankly I’ve been asked this for a while and I never have a great pithy explanation, but it is basically believing that kids can do some things on their own — the way most of today’s parents and certainly the grandparents remember as kids.  
What’s strange about childhood today is the fact that kids do almost nothing on their own.  
We did a study with Harris Poll and they found that the majority of kids aged 8–12 have rarely or never walked around their own neighborhood without an adult. More than 50% had never gone to another aisle at the grocery without an adult. 25% weren’t allowed to play on their own front lawn.  
There was this amazing piece in the Daily Mail — I know it’s the Daily Mail — called “How Children Lost the Right to Roam in Four Generations.” It showed that childhood is shrinking.  
Free-Range Kids is trying to make it easy, normal, and legal to widen that again — to trust kids with some independence.

**W（主持人）**：这么多年过去了，大家还是对此着迷。你能给我们解释一下“Free-Range Kids（放养孩子）”到底是什么意思吗？

**L（Lenore）**：我就知道你要问，老实说这问题我被问过无数次了，我一直没有特别简洁的答案，但本质就是：相信孩子可以自己做一些事——就像今天的大多数父母、尤其是祖辈小时候那样。  
现在童年奇怪的地方在于，孩子几乎什么都不能自己做。  
我们和哈里斯民调合作做过一个研究，发现8-12岁的大多数孩子很少或从未在没有大人陪同的情况下在自己小区里走动；超过50%的孩子从未在超市自己去过另一个货架区；25%的孩子不被允许在自家前院玩。  
《每日邮报》有一篇很棒的文章（我知道是《每日邮报》），标题是《四代人如何失去漫游的权利》，它用地图展示了童年的活动范围在不断缩小。  
“放养孩子”运动就是想让这种范围重新扩大变得容易、正常、并且合法——让孩子重新获得一定程度的独立。

**W:** Why do you think modern parenting has become so focused on safety and control?

**L:** This is my favorite topic. I would say the change really began in earnest in the 80s and into the 90s.  
1. We got 24-hour cable news — suddenly there was a need to fill all those hours with upsetting content.  
2. There were two very high-profile kidnappings (Etán Patz in 1979, Adam Walsh in 1982) that terrified the country and were turned into media spectacles.  
The media realized that “missing cute white kid” stories sold incredibly well, so they kept giving us more and more of them.  
Gradually, the idea that predators were everywhere became the default belief, even though statistically stranger abductions are extremely rare.  
In one Harris Poll, 50% of parents said that if two 10-year-olds were playing unsupervised in a park, they were likely to be kidnapped. That’s wildly out of whack with reality, but that’s the drumbeat of terror we’ve been living with.

**W（主持人）**：为什么现代养育变得如此聚焦于安全和控制？

**L（Lenore）**：这是我最喜欢的话题。我认为真正的转变是从80年代到90年代开始的。  
1. 有线电视24小时新闻出现——必须用让人不安的内容填满所有时间；  
2. 发生了两起轰动全国的绑架案（1979年的Etán Patz和1982年的Adam Walsh），媒体把它们做成了超级卖点。  
媒体发现“失踪的可爱白人小孩”故事特别能吸引观众，就不停地给我们更多类似内容。  
慢慢地，“到处都是掠食者”的观念成了默认信念，尽管数据上陌生人绑架极其罕见。  
在一次哈里斯民调里，50%的父母认为如果两个10岁孩子在公园无人看管地玩，很可能会被绑架。这和现实完全脱节，但这就是我们几十年来被灌输的恐惧鼓点。

**W:** What are some of the hidden costs of this overprotective parenting?

**L:** For kids: they are becoming more anxious and depressed. Peter Gray (psychology professor, my Let Grow co-founder) showed that as children’s independence has gone down since the 1950s, their rates of anxiety and depression have gone up — and it’s causation, not just correlation.  
When childhood becomes micromanaged, kids develop an external locus of control: someone else is always deciding what they do and whether it’s good enough. That kills confidence.  
For parents: you’re exhausted, you have zero time, you’re driving everywhere. One unspoken reason birth rates are falling may be that parenting has become such a joyless, 24/7 job.

**W（主持人）**：过度保护的养育有哪些隐藏成本？

**L（Lenore）**：对孩子：他们越来越焦虑、抑郁。心理学家Peter Gray的研究显示，从50年代到现在，孩子独立性下降的同时，焦虑和抑郁率上升——而且是因果关系，不是巧合。  
当童年被微观管理，孩子会形成“外部控制点”：总有人在决定他们该干什么、做得够不够好。这会摧毁自信。  
对父母：你们累得要死，完全没有自己的时间，到处接送孩子。生育率下降的一个潜台词可能就是：养孩子变成了一件毫无乐趣、24小时待命的工作。

**W:** You say “I did it myself” are childhood’s magic words and the original anxiety-buster远程

**L:** Yes. Risk-taking and small successes build resilience.  
I always ask audiences: “What did you do as a kid that went really wrong but you never told your parents?” People tell amazing stories — crashing bikes, getting lost, playing dangerous games — and they hid it because they didn’t want to lose their freedom.  
That’s the opposite of anxiety. Anxiety is “What if I mess up and it’s terrible forever?” Real life teaches: “I messed up… and I handled it.” That’s the best antidote.

**W（主持人）**：你说“我自己做到了”是童年最神奇的咒语，也是最初的焦虑克星。

**L（Lenore）**：对。适当冒险和小成功能建立韧性。  
我常问听众：“你小时候干过什么特别出错但死都不敢告诉父母的事？”大家讲的故事都特别精彩——摔车、迷路、玩危险游戏——他们之所以瞒着，就是不想失去自由。  
这和焦虑完全相反。焦虑是“我万一搞砸了就永远糟糕了”，而真实生活教给你的是：“我搞砸了……但我搞定了。”这是最好的解药。

**W:** What are simple, practical first steps for parents who want to give kids more freedom without feeling reckless?

**L:** First: it’s not reckless to give kids some freedom; it’s reckless not to.  
The easiest way is collectively. That’s why Let Grow has schools give every kid the same homework: “Go home and do something new on your own (with your parents’ permission but without your parent).”  
When every third-grader is suddenly walking to the store or making dinner, you’re not the “crazy mom” anymore — it becomes normal again.  
And when your six-year-old comes back with only cookies instead of the shopping list, your heart grows three sizes. You have to let go a little before you’re 100% ready — because you become ready the moment they walk back in the door smiling.

**W（主持人）**：对想给孩子更多自由但又怕不负责任的家长，有什么简单实际的第一步？

**L（Lenore）**：首先：给孩子一点自由不是不负责，不给才是。  
最简单的方法是集体行动。这就是Let Grow让学校给所有孩子布置同一个作业的原因：“回家做一件你以前没做过的新事情（父母允许，但父母不陪同）”。  
当全班三年级的小孩突然都开始自己去商店、做晚饭，你就不再是“疯妈妈”了——这又变成了正常的事。  
当你六岁的孩子拎着一袋饼干而不是购物单上的东西回来时，你的心会瞬间变大三倍。你得在自己100%准备好之前就先放手一点——因为当他们笑着自己走进家门的那一刻，你就准备好了。

**W:** A single parent asks: I can’t influence the whole classroom. How do I do this without being judged?

**L:** Find one friend. Two moms sit at Starbucks and send the kids to the dollar store at the other end of the strip mall with $10. Everything is easier with a buddy — for the kids and for you.  
Also: all the Let Grow materials are free (letgrow.org). There’s a “4 Weeks to a Let Grow Kid” program.  
Other ideas people have started:  
- “Free Play Fridays” — one kid put flyers in mailboxes, 20 kids showed up to the park with no adults.  
- “Friendship Club” — 3–4 neighborhood families agree: if my kid knocks on your door and yours is free, they play, no scheduled playdate needed. That’s what normal life used to be.

**W（主持人）**：一位单亲家长问：我没法影响整个班级，怎么做才不会被评判？

**L（Lenore）**：找一个朋友。两个妈妈坐在星巴克，让孩子拿10美元去商场另一头的1元店。有人一起做，对孩子和家长都更容易。  
Let Grow所有材料都是免费的（letgrow.org），有“四周打造放养孩子”计划。  
其他人已经开始的点子：  
- “自由玩耍星期五”——一个孩子在邻居信箱里塞传单，结果20个孩子没大人陪就到了公园。  
- “友谊俱乐部”——小区里3-4个家庭约定：我家孩子敲你家门，你家孩子有空就一起玩，不用提前约。这就是我们小时候的正常生活啊。

**W:** How can grandparents help without undermining their own kids’ parenting?

**L:** Don’t lecture. Just casually share Peter Gray’s TEDx talk on why unsupervised free play is formative. Frame it as “this will actually help them get ahead.”  
Also remind them: when we asked 8–12-year-olds how they most want to hang out with friends, the overwhelming #1 answer was “just play outside, no agenda, no adults.” Screens came in distant third. Kids want real life if we give it to them.

**W（主持人）**：祖父母怎么帮忙又不破坏自己孩子的权威？

**L（Lenore）**：别说教。随口分享Peter Gray关于无监督自由玩耍对孩子成长重要性的TEDx演讲就好，把它包装成“这其实能帮孩子更优秀”。  
还可以提醒他们：我们问8-12岁孩子最想怎么和朋友玩，压倒性第一是“随便在外面玩，没计划、没大人”。屏幕排老三。如果我们给他们真实的生活，他们其实很想要。

**W:** Last question — what gives you hope?

**L:** The fact that we’re having this conversation. Seventeen years ago I was voted “most controversial mommy blogger in America.” Today I’m on TED — twice. The culture is shifting.  
Kids naturally want to grow, explore, take on the world. Let Grow’s slogan is: When adults step back, kids step up.  
That never changes. That gives me hope.

**W（主持人）**：最后一个问题——是什么让你保持希望？

**L（Lenore）**：我们正在进行这场对话这件事。17年前我被选为“美国最具争议妈妈博主”，今天我上了TED——还两次。文化正在改变。  
孩子天生就想成长、探索、征服世界。Let Grow的口号是：大人退后一步，孩子上前一步。  
这点永远不会变。这让我充满希望。
