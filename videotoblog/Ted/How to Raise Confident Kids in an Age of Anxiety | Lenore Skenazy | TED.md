### 英文原文 + 中文翻译（两人对话形式）

**W:** You actually start your talk by mentioning that you have been called America's worst mom after you let your nine-year-old ride the New York City subway alone, and you embraced that title. So while maybe not initially, but when you look back at that moment, what do you think struck a cultural nerve?

**L:** So that he’s 27 now, so I’ve been thinking about it for a while. And I think two things struck a nerve… Because I looked at older columns of mine where I had let my kids play in the courtyard without me, I let them take elevators without me, I let them go — they’re two boys — let them go to the men’s room without me obviously, and nobody cared about any of those columns.  
So I think by writing about my kid taking the subway by himself, it was basically “the subway”. Hey, New York City subway does not have a great reputation, and people think it’s hell, and “why would you send your kid down to hell, at least without you?”  
And then I think it wasn’t just me saying “kids need independence.” It was me actually doing it — pedal to the metal — and the fact that he loved it. It wasn’t something that we did because “he should learn, he should be toughened up.” It was just: he wanted to take the subway by himself and we let him. It’s like, “Oh yeah, kids have things that they want to do on their own, and maybe we should listen to them and see what happens.”  
So yeah, I think it’s the subway.

**W（主持人）**：你在一开始就提到，因为你让9岁的儿子独自坐纽约地铁，你被称作“美国最烂的妈妈”，而且你还接受了这个称号。回过头来看那一刻，你觉得是什么触动了文化的神经？

**L（Lenore）**：他现在27岁了，所以我已经想这个问题很久了。我觉得有两点触动了神经……我翻看了以前写的专栏，我让孩子在没有我的情况下在院子里玩、自己坐电梯、两个男孩自己去男厕所，显然没人关心那些文章。  
所以当我写孩子独自坐地铁的时候，关键就在于“地铁”。纽约地铁名声不好，大家觉得那是地狱，“你为什么要把孩子一个人送下去，至少你得陪着啊？”  
而且这不只是我说“孩子需要独立”，而是我真的去做到了——全力以赴——而且他还特别开心。我们不是因为“他该学习独立、该被锻炼”才让他去的，只是他自己想一个人坐地铁，我们就让他坐了。这就像在说：“哦，对哦，孩子有自己想做的事，也许我们该听听他们的，看看会发生什么。”  
所以，对，就是地铁。

**W:** All these years later it’s still something that people are obsessed with. Could you talk a little bit about what exactly “free-range kids” means?

**L:** I knew you were going to ask, and frankly I’ve been asked this for a while and I never have a great pithy explanation, but it is basically believing that kids can do some things on their own — the way most of today’s parents and certainly the grandparents remember as kids.  
What’s strange about childhood today is the fact that kids do almost nothing on their own.  
We did a study with Harris Poll and they found that the majority of kids aged 8–12 have rarely or never walked around their own neighborhood without an adult. More than 50% had never gone to another aisle at the grocery without an adult. 25% weren’t allowed to play on their own front lawn.  
There was this amazing piece in the Daily Mail — I know it’s the Daily Mail — called “How Children Lost the Right to Roam in Four Generations.” It showed that childhood is shrinking.  
Free-Range Kids is trying to make it easy, normal, and legal to widen that again — to trust kids with some independence.

**W（主持人）**：这么多年过去了，大家还是对此着迷。你能给我们解释一下“Free-Range Kids（放养孩子）”到底是什么意思吗？

**L（Lenore）**：我就知道你要问，老实说这问题我被问过无数次了，我一直没有特别简洁的答案，但本质就是：相信孩子可以自己做一些事——就像今天的大多数父母、尤其是祖辈小时候那样。  
现在童年奇怪的地方在于，孩子几乎什么都不能自己做。  
我们和哈里斯民调合作做过一个研究，发现8-12岁的大多数孩子很少或从未在没有大人陪同的情况下在自己小区里走动；超过50%的孩子从未在超市自己去过另一个货架区；25%的孩子不被允许在自家前院玩。  
《每日邮报》有一篇很棒的文章（我知道是《每日邮报》），标题是《四代人如何失去漫游的权利》，它用地图展示了童年的活动范围在不断缩小。  
“放养孩子”运动就是想让这种范围重新扩大变得容易、正常、并且合法——让孩子重新获得一定程度的独立。

**W:** Why do you think modern parenting has become so focused on safety and control?

**L:** This is my favorite topic. I would say the change really began in earnest in the 80s and into the 90s.  
1. We got 24-hour cable news — suddenly there was a need to fill all those hours with upsetting content.  
2. There were two very high-profile kidnappings (Etán Patz in 1979, Adam Walsh in 1982) that terrified the country and were turned into media spectacles.  
The media realized that “missing cute white kid” stories sold incredibly well, so they kept giving us more and more of them.  
Gradually, the idea that predators were everywhere became the default belief, even though statistically stranger abductions are extremely rare.  
In one Harris Poll, 50% of parents said that if two 10-year-olds were playing unsupervised in a park, they were likely to be kidnapped. That’s wildly out of whack with reality, but that’s the drumbeat of terror we’ve been living with.

**W（主持人）**：为什么现代养育变得如此聚焦于安全和控制？

**L（Lenore）**：这是我最喜欢的话题。我认为真正的转变是从80年代到90年代开始的。  
1. 有线电视24小时新闻出现——必须用让人不安的内容填满所有时间；  
2. 发生了两起轰动全国的绑架案（1979年的Etán Patz和1982年的Adam Walsh），媒体把它们做成了超级卖点。  
媒体发现“失踪的可爱白人小孩”故事特别能吸引观众，就不停地给我们更多类似内容。  
慢慢地，“到处都是掠食者”的观念成了默认信念，尽管数据上陌生人绑架极其罕见。  
在一次哈里斯民调里，50%的父母认为如果两个10岁孩子在公园无人看管地玩，很可能会被绑架。这和现实完全脱节，但这就是我们几十年来被灌输的恐惧鼓点。

**W:** What are some of the hidden costs of this overprotective parenting?

**L:** For kids: they are becoming more anxious and depressed. Peter Gray (psychology professor, my Let Grow co-founder) showed that as children’s independence has gone down since the 1950s, their rates of anxiety and depression have gone up — and it’s causation, not just correlation.  
When childhood becomes micromanaged, kids develop an external locus of control: someone else is always deciding what they do and whether it’s good enough. That kills confidence.  
For parents: you’re exhausted, you have zero time, you’re driving everywhere. One unspoken reason birth rates are falling may be that parenting has become such a joyless, 24/7 job.

**W（主持人）**：过度保护的养育有哪些隐藏成本？

**L（Lenore）**：对孩子：他们越来越焦虑、抑郁。心理学家Peter Gray的研究显示，从50年代到现在，孩子独立性下降的同时，焦虑和抑郁率上升——而且是因果关系，不是巧合。  
当童年被微观管理，孩子会形成“外部控制点”：总有人在决定他们该干什么、做得够不够好。这会摧毁自信。  
对父母：你们累得要死，完全没有自己的时间，到处接送孩子。生育率下降的一个潜台词可能就是：养孩子变成了一件毫无乐趣、24小时待命的工作。

**W:** You say “I did it myself” are childhood’s magic words and the original anxiety-buster远程

**L:** Yes. Risk-taking and small successes build resilience.  
I always ask audiences: “What did you do as a kid that went really wrong but you never told your parents?” People tell amazing stories — crashing bikes, getting lost, playing dangerous games — and they hid it because they didn’t want to lose their freedom.  
That’s the opposite of anxiety. Anxiety is “What if I mess up and it’s terrible forever?” Real life teaches: “I messed up… and I handled it.” That’s the best antidote.

**W（主持人）**：你说“我自己做到了”是童年最神奇的咒语，也是最初的焦虑克星。

**L（Lenore）**：对。适当冒险和小成功能建立韧性。  
我常问听众：“你小时候干过什么特别出错但死都不敢告诉父母的事？”大家讲的故事都特别精彩——摔车、迷路、玩危险游戏——他们之所以瞒着，就是不想失去自由。  
这和焦虑完全相反。焦虑是“我万一搞砸了就永远糟糕了”，而真实生活教给你的是：“我搞砸了……但我搞定了。”这是最好的解药。

**W:** What are simple, practical first steps for parents who want to give kids more freedom without feeling reckless?

**L:** First: it’s not reckless to give kids some freedom; it’s reckless not to.  
The easiest way is collectively. That’s why Let Grow has schools give every kid the same homework: “Go home and do something new on your own (with your parents’ permission but without your parent).”  
When every third-grader is suddenly walking to the store or making dinner, you’re not the “crazy mom” anymore — it becomes normal again.  
And when your six-year-old comes back with only cookies instead of the shopping list, your heart grows three sizes. You have to let go a little before you’re 100% ready — because you become ready the moment they walk back in the door smiling.

**W（主持人）**：对想给孩子更多自由但又怕不负责任的家长，有什么简单实际的第一步？

**L（Lenore）**：首先：给孩子一点自由不是不负责，不给才是。  
最简单的方法是集体行动。这就是Let Grow让学校给所有孩子布置同一个作业的原因：“回家做一件你以前没做过的新事情（父母允许，但父母不陪同）”。  
当全班三年级的小孩突然都开始自己去商店、做晚饭，你就不再是“疯妈妈”了——这又变成了正常的事。  
当你六岁的孩子拎着一袋饼干而不是购物单上的东西回来时，你的心会瞬间变大三倍。你得在自己100%准备好之前就先放手一点——因为当他们笑着自己走进家门的那一刻，你就准备好了。

---

**W:** A single parent asks: I can’t influence the whole classroom. How do I do this without being judged?

**L:** Find one friend. Two moms sit at Starbucks and send the kids to the dollar store at the other end of the strip mall with $10. Everything is easier with a buddy — for the kids and for you.  
Also: all the Let Grow materials are free (letgrow.org). There’s a “4 Weeks to a Let Grow Kid” program.  
Other ideas people have started:  
- “Free Play Fridays” — one kid put flyers in mailboxes, 20 kids showed up to the park with no adults.  
- “Friendship Club” — 3–4 neighborhood families agree: if my kid knocks on your door and yours is free, they play, no scheduled playdate needed. That’s what normal life used to be.

**W（主持人）**：一位单亲家长问：我没法影响整个班级，怎么做才不会被评判？

**L（Lenore）**：找一个朋友。两个妈妈坐在星巴克，让孩子拿10美元去商场另一头的1元店。有人一起做，对孩子和家长都更容易。  
Let Grow所有材料都是免费的（letgrow.org），有“四周打造放养孩子”计划。  
其他人已经开始的点子：  
- “自由玩耍星期五”——一个孩子在邻居信箱里塞传单，结果20个孩子没大人陪就到了公园。  
- “友谊俱乐部”——小区里3-4个家庭约定：我家孩子敲你家门，你家孩子有空就一起玩，不用提前约。这就是我们小时候的正常生活啊。

**W:** How can grandparents help without undermining their own kids’ parenting?

**L:** Don’t lecture. Just casually share Peter Gray’s TEDx talk on why unsupervised free play is formative. Frame it as “this will actually help them get ahead.”  
Also remind them: when we asked 8–12-year-olds how they most want to hang out with friends, the overwhelming #1 answer was “just play outside, no agenda, no adults.” Screens came in distant third. Kids want real life if we give it to them.

**W（主持人）**：祖父母怎么帮忙又不破坏自己孩子的权威？

**L（Lenore）**：别说教。随口分享Peter Gray关于无监督自由玩耍对孩子成长重要性的TEDx演讲就好，把它包装成“这其实能帮孩子更优秀”。  
还可以提醒他们：我们问8-12岁孩子最想怎么和朋友玩，压倒性第一是“随便在外面玩，没计划、没大人”。屏幕排老三。如果我们给他们真实的生活，他们其实很想要。

---

**W:** Last question — what gives you hope?

**L:** The fact that we’re having this conversation. Seventeen years ago I was voted “most controversial mommy blogger in America.” Today I’m on TED — twice. The culture is shifting.  
Kids naturally want to grow, explore, take on the world. Let Grow’s slogan is: When adults step back, kids step up.  
That never changes. That gives me hope.

**W（主持人）**：最后一个问题——是什么让你保持希望？

**L（Lenore）**：我们正在进行这场对话这件事。17年前我被选为“美国最具争议妈妈博主”，今天我上了TED——还两次。文化正在改变。  
孩子天生就想成长、探索、征服世界。Let Grow的口号是：大人退后一步，孩子上前一步。  
这点永远不会变。这让我充满希望。

**Lenore**: So that he’s 27 now, so I’ve been thinking about it for a while.

It wasn’t something that we did because he should do it, he should learn, he should be tough, toughened up. It was just he wanted to take the subway by himself and we let him. It’s like, oh yeah, kids have things that they want to do on their own, and maybe we should listen to them and see what happens. So but I think it’s the subway.

**Host**: Yeah. Well I mean, and all these years later it’s still something that people are still, it seems like, obsessed with and concerned by this idea of letting kids go on their own. And so could you, I guess, talk a little bit about this — for those people who are new to your work, what exactly does “free-range kids” mean?

**Lenore**: I knew you were going to ask, and frankly I’ve been asked this for a while, and I never have a great pat explanation, but it is basically believing that kids can do some things on their own the way most of today’s parents — and certainly the grandparents — remember as kids. What’s strange about childhood today is the fact that kids do almost nothing on their own. And I have some statistics: we did a study with the Harris Poll people, and they found that the majority of kids aged 8 to 12 have rarely or never walked around their own neighborhood without an adult. More than 50% had never gone to another aisle at the grocery without an adult. 25% weren’t allowed to play on their own front lawn. So it’s like, why have a front lawn, you know, if kids aren’t allowed there? Also there was this really amazing piece done in — I know it’s the Daily Mail, but nonetheless — the Daily Mail did an incredible story several years back and it was called “How Children Lost the Right to Roam in Four Generations.” And it interviewed — it had a map but it interviewed — a great-grandpa, 88, how far had he gone as a kid? He’d gone six miles in any direction. And then the grandpa, 66, had gone about a mile to the fishing hole, and then the mother who was in her 40s had walked half a mile to school, and her son who was eight was not allowed — I can’t remember if it’s not allowed off his block or not allowed off his yard. But the map that showed this just showed really childhood shrinking, and Free-Range Kids is trying to make it easy, normal, and legal to widen that again, to trust kids with some independence. And that’s what Let Grow, the nonprofit that grew out of Free-Range Kids, is working on.

**Host**: And we’ll definitely talk more about some of the work you’re doing with Let Grow, but before we get into that I’d love to just keep going on this thread around how independence for children has really begun to shrink. Why do you think modern parenting has become so focused on safety and control? This is my favorite topic, and we don’t have 24 hours, we just have one.

**Lenore**: I would say that the change really began in earnest in the 80s and into the 90s. And a couple things changed back then that were significant. One is that we got cable television in the 80s, which meant that we suddenly had a 24-hour news cycle, which had never been the case before. And of course if you have to keep people glued to the screen for all those hours, you have to find very compelling — and I would say very upsetting — content, as we’ve learned from later on with the internet. And so that’s when we started to sort of obsess about stranger danger. And also there were two very high-profile kidnappings in New York, my city: in 1979 a boy named Etan Patz was taken from a bus stop and never seen again. And what was interesting about that case, aside from utter tragedy, is that the working assumption on the part of the public at the beginning was that some lovelorn lady had seen this cute little kid and taken him home to raise as her own. So we weren’t thinking at all about predators. And predators then were like lions and owls. And so it was only gradually, as word got out — maybe from the police and from the news — that well maybe it wasn’t a lady, maybe it wasn’t taken home to raise, that people became just shocked that there would be this weird and horrible and disgusting and upsetting crime. And then when it happened to Adam Walsh — was taken from outside of a Sears in Florida in 1982 — there was a miniseries done on him that broke all ratings records. And you know the news and the media are there to make money, right, not just to inform you and help you but really to make money. And when they saw that this is what really captivated audiences the most, they said “Get me more of these. Don’t steal more children, get me more content like this,” because the appetite for this has been unending. And we know that because to this day Law & Order I think has been on for like 25 or 30 years, and every day people are tuning in to see just the most depraved and upsetting crimes. And you know you breathe these in and gradually your lungs fill with this despair, and what seemed to be almost unheard of in the Etan Patz case in 1979 becomes something like — the same Harris poll interviewed parents, and what was it — 50% of parents, when asked what would happen if there were two kids aged 10 — double digits — playing at the park together, what is likely to happen, and 50% of the parents said they were likely to be kidnapped. That’s wildly out of whack with reality, thank God. But that’s the result of this constant drumbeat of terror and despair that we are marinating in thanks to the media.

**Host**: So when we think about this then, now everyone has decided “keep them close, don’t let them roam,” as you say. What are some of the hidden costs of this overprotective parenting for both parents and kids?

**Lenore**: Well let’s talk about kids first. And I feel bad because my TED talk was really funny and now we’re getting really somber, but the sad thing for kids is that they are sad. They are getting anxious and depressed. And we all know this, but people think it’s since COVID or since phones or whatever, since No Child Left Behind — it’s really been decades in the making. One of my Let Grow co-founders is a man named Peter Gray — he’s a professor of psychology at Boston College. And he did a big long study that was published in the Journal of Pediatrics two years ago, and it showed that over the decades, from the 50s to now, as kids’ independence — ability to roam, problem-solve, play on their own — has gone down, their anxiety and depression have been going up. And he argues that it’s not just correlation, it’s causation. Then you could sort of understand that because if you were in a job and you were micromanaged all the time and somebody was saying “Whitney, why don’t you try it this way? Whitney, that’s good but maybe you want to think about this. Whitney, will you have this to me by 5:02 today?” — nobody wants to be micromanaged, and childhood has become micromanaged. And the other thing Peter Gray explains which I think is really right is that there’s something called an internal locus of control versus external locus of control. And what external is when somebody else is deciding how you spend your day and whether you’re doing it good enough and gives you all this feedback and tells you what you’re going to do next. And internal is when you feel like “I really feel like going and looking for bugs today” or “I just want to get better at my free throws” or “I’m going to go on my skateboard.” When you have an internal locus of control — means an intrinsic, so hard to say — desire to do something and you go and do it, you feel like you can handle things, even if you fall off the skateboard, even if you don’t find a bug, which would be odd. So when you have this feeling like “I can handle things and people trust me, and if things go wrong I’m going to be able to figure out how to make them better,” you feel great. You’re on top of the world. And we have taken most of that out of children’s lives because we’re so worried about them that we do everything with them and for them. And as a result they’re sort of — they’re like in the passenger seat of their lives while we very smart, helpful people are driving them to something that’s going to be really important for them, especially if they’re trying to get into college.

**Host**: And I love in the talk — and I promise we’re gonna come away from some of the somber stuff to the light — in the talk you say that “I did it myself” are both childhood’s magic words and the original anxiety buster. Could you say more about that? What role does risk-taking and independence play in raising resilient children?

**Lenore**: I’d say it plays a huge role. And you probably remember this from your own childhood — something that you did yourself that you thought was a little scary or you’re still proud of to this day. Sometimes I ask people, “What did you do as a kid that went really wrong?” And I’ll just tell you one quick story, which is I was at an education conference of some sort and one of the ladies told me that when she was a kid she and her friends were riding their bikes down this — I’m sure it seemed like an incredible mountain, it was probably just a little hill — but it was covered with pine needles. And when she went down, you know, it was really slick and fast. And so she’s going down and she’s holding on to the handle brakes and she goes like this to brake because she’s at the bottom, and the handlebars came off the bike. So suddenly it’s like “ah!” like a cartoon, and she had a split second to decide what to do and she threw herself into a bush, right, and she got all scraped up and it was okay, and she put the handlebars back on. She kept doing it. And I said, “Well, you know, what did you tell your parents?” and she’s like, “I didn’t tell my parents.” And then when other people in the audience started telling stories — like this one guy, I think it was a principal, got lost on some family hike and he had to actually hitchhike back to where they were, and of course he didn’t tell his parents. And some guy played Mumbly Peg, which is the stupidest game on earth where you throw a knife at each other’s feet — and of course somebody’s foot got hurt and they hid the fact that they were taking him up to the bathroom to wash off his foot and get the blood down the drain and put on a band-aid — “Oh he’s fine, just taking a shower,” you know — and none of them had told their parents. And when I said why, it was because they didn’t want their parents to know and then therefore take away their independence. So their independence was just innately so important to them that they were treasuring it and protecting it, and they were doing two things at once: they were protecting their independence and they were saying to themselves “Look what I can handle.” And anxiety is the opposite of that. Anxiety is when you worry like “Oh you know this seems hard. What if I mess up? If I mess up it’ll be terrible, I’ll be embarrassed. And if I’m hurt it will be forever, so I might as well not do it.” I have to tell you, Nike just changed its slogan like last week. And while they’re keeping “Just Do It,” they added the new slogan “Why do it?” Like “Why do it?” And it’s a recognition that kids are so afraid of messing up because they’re watched all the time. So there’s high stakes — you’re always being judged, you’re always being protected, and you never have a chance to see how much you can do. So you finally just go, “Well, why do it?” You know, I’ll look stupid. Maybe somebody puts my reel on Instagram. Maybe I feel bad about myself. Maybe I’ll get hurt. And so if Nike is recognizing a pervasive passivity in kids — even wanting to play — I mean Nike is about playing, right? — then something has gone awry. And so if you’re asking what’s the problem in the culture, it’s that we’re taking the childhood — the child — out of childhood and replacing it with adult-oriented, adult-run activities and adult-supervised activities to the point where kids are like “Okay, it’s yours. Tell me what to do, I’ll do it.” But otherwise, why do it?

**Host**: Well okay, we’ve set the stage now for why thinking about this and having these conversations with yourself and your children, your community, is really important. Our member audience is so eager to hear you share more about how we actually do this. So I’m going to integrate in some questions that we’re getting from the members. But before we get there, if you could just start us off with your simple, small steps for how people can practically begin to give their kids more freedom without feeling reckless.

**Lenore**: First of all, it’s not reckless to give your kids some freedom. I would argue that it’s reckless not to give them some freedom for the reasons we’ve already discussed. But I recognize that it is hard in a culture that says — there are schools that won’t let the kids get off the bus at the end of the day unless a parent is there to walk them home. And it could be two blocks, it could be two houses. I was actually giving a talk — I have no idea where I was — but the audience members told me that their school the bus stops at each person’s house and drops them off at the end of the driveway, and you still have to come out of your house to get the kid. You can’t wave from the window. You have to come down and get them. So this is a culture that is demanding a level of safety and supervision and help for the kids that is just off the charts. So I don’t blame parents for being helicopters because the culture is recommending it and sometimes often enough demanding it. And so you know, Skechers shoes for kids — they now have a hole underneath the insole where you can put a tracking device. I mean that’s how normalized constant supervision has become. But the way to fight it — the easiest way to change anything is collectively. If we’re all afraid to send our kids outside — “What are the other parents going to think? Is it too tough? Is it too soon? Is my kid too spacey?” — is to have everybody doing it at once. And so that’s why Let Grow, the nonprofit that grew out of Free-Range Kids, recommends that schools give kids a homework assignment called the Let Grow Experience. It’s free, where every kid gets the homework that says “Go home and do something new on your own with your parents’ permission but without your parents.” And then we give a list of giant — you can climb a tree, you can make pancakes, you can walk to the store, whatever it is. But if everybody is doing it — all the third graders are getting themselves to their guitar lessons or picking up the milk for dinner — you’re not the crazy mom letting them do it, and all the kids are talking to each other and all the parents are talking to each other, and you’ve renormalized letting go. But letting go is not just good because “okay they’re getting a little independence, maybe they’re less anxious.” Letting go is really important because it rewires you, the parent, because when you see your kid come back from that errand and they got the milk — or I was just talking to a lady today who was — I’m losing my mind — but oh, she let her kid go into the grocery and get the things for dinner, and he came out, he was six, he came out with only cookies, right? And I was like “I agree with that, I think that makes a great dinner.” But she was a little disappointed but also so proud because he’d gone in and he came out and he said “I think I got the exact change, didn’t I?” And then they’re looking over the change. And you, the parent — it’s like the Grinch, your heart grows three sizes when you see your kid do something on their own. And that’s the only solution. You almost have to let your kid go a little before you’re totally ready, because you will be ready when they come home, and they will come home. And if they screwed up, that’s okay too, because then you realize it’s okay — he got a little lost or he only bought the cookies, and that’s okay too. And you just have to realize that this level of supervision and hypervigilance is new and unnecessary. And it’s not only a burden to a kid, it’s a burden to you because it has made your job as a parent watching every single second. You know you can’t send them to get the bananas. That’s too much to ask of any parent. You know the birth rates are going down, and I think maybe one unspoken reason — maybe even subconscious reason — is that it’s becoming such a drag. You have zero time. Parents today are spending way more time with their kids than our parents spent with us because they think they have to be there to knit every sign-up and to watch every playdate and to eat every piece of pizza at every party.

**Host**: But one thing you touched on just now as well is this idea of getting other people involved. You talk about with Let Grow how you have this assignment for schools where they can encourage children to be more independent. And so we have a question actually from Lorie C — if she, just as a single parent and not somebody who can influence what’s happening in her child’s classroom, what advice do you have for parents who want to give their kids more freedom but maybe feel judged by other parents or family members? How can they help bring other people along on this journey?

**Lenore**: The family members a little harder. But I would say find a friend. I’ve heard of parents who — two women go and sit at Starbucks and they send their kids to the other end of the strip mall and “here’s $10, go buy something at the dollar store or go pick up the dry cleaning, we’ll be here.” It’s really much easier for your kid and for you — you’re distracted because you’re talking to your friend, and your kid has somebody to do something with. I mean everything’s more fun with a friend. So I’d say find a couple of people who want to practice this with you. All the stuff at Let Grow is free — so I’m gonna — it’s LetGrow.org — we have “Four Weeks to a Let Grow Kid,” and it’s like the first week is have kids start doing stuff for themselves that you’ve been doing for them — whether that’s tying their shoes or getting them out the door or let them bake cookies and they take them out of the oven themselves, imagine that. And then the next week is getting around the neighborhood, and then there’s do something with a friend, and I have no idea what the fourth week is but you’ll find it out. And another thing that somebody once recommended to me — there’s two cool things. One is Free Play Fridays, and I actually just heard of a kid who organized a Free Play Friday in his neighborhood. He went around, he put postcards in everybody’s mailbox and it said “Friday afternoon like at 3:00, 3 to 6 or 3:00 to 5:00, how about all the kids — no grown-ups, don’t come. Grown-ups meet at Locust Park or whatever and we’ll just see what happens, we’ll just play.” And he didn’t know if anybody was gonna come. And to his delight and surprise 20 kids showed up, and the mom sent photos and it just looked like the Peanuts gang — minus Lucy being a jerk — but it was just kids in the park, some of them were playing with a ball and some of them were doing whatever. And it’s just so great. I mean it fills your heart as much as it’s fulfilling for kids. So that’s one idea — Free Play Fridays. Just use a listserv, use NextDoor, use Facebook and say “How about we all send our kids to the park on Fridays?” And Fridays because it leads into the weekend and maybe they’ll do it again on their own for the rest of the weekend. And the other thing is this one mom in California started what she called a Friendship Club, and that was she found her son had like three or four friends in the neighborhood and she contacted them and she said “How about we form a Friendship Club,” which in my day would have just been called normal life — where if my kid knocks on your door and your kid is free, “Is Cynthia home?” or “Is Oliver home?” “Yes.” Okay, then they come in, they don’t have to organize a playdate beforehand. You’re not going to see this as an imposition, I’m not using you as a babysitter — or maybe I am but you can do the same with me. And so then the kid has like three or four doors that he can knock on anytime of day, I would say. And they can go play outside, they can play in the lawn, the front lawn, the back lawn, they can go to the park. And that just sort of re-knits the neighborhood too. And also I think one of the things Peter Gray always says is that kids are not attracted just because there’s a sidewalk and a tree outside — they’re attracted by other kids. And once you have some kids playing in the neighborhood — and I’ve seen this — then other kids start joining them. Once you have a couple kids walking to school, other kids start joining them. So you just want to sort of re-seed the neighborhood with kids. And you do that with a little bit of planning with the other parents.

**Host**: I love all of these ideas. And we have so many other questions about different people within the community and how they can be involved in this. So there’s a few members who are curious about how grandparents can support. Richard R for instance — do you have any suggestions on how to constructively help our children let their own children grow without risking undermining their trust in us as caregivers?

**Lenore**: I feel for grandparents because a lot of us can remember this free-range childhood, and then we see the kids scheduled within an inch of their lives. I’d say maybe you just happen to leave the — Peter Gray had a great TEDx talk about how free play is just so formative for kids. And so maybe if you help the parents see — without lecturing them — that this free time is not stupid wasted time, interstitial time between the important time of chess, soccer, and school, but it’s when they’re learning how to make a friend, how to compromise, how to explain an idea, how to be creative. If parents are very concerned about every aspect of their kids’ lives, and if they see that free play, unsupervised free play, is actually educational and will get their kids ahead, then it becomes something that’s sort of speaking their language. Another thing that’s really helpful is when we did this Harris poll we were asking kids about their phone use as well as their independence, and it turned out that parents are very very concerned about phones and screens. So this is a way to speak their language about that, which is that when the kids were asked — these are kids 8 to 12 — given the choice of how to hang out or play with your friends, would you rather just play with them old-fashioned way, outside, no agenda, no adults watching, just figure out what to do, have fun that way, or would you rather be in an organized activity like soccer or travel baseball or piano recital, ballet, or would you rather be online with them playing games or just socializing or scrolling together — what would you prefer to do? And the vast majority, the overwhelming majority, was free play. They just want to be with their friends. And then second choice was the organized activity, and third choice — the distant third — was being online. So I know we all complain “kids are glued to their screens, that’s all they want to do, once they get it it’s like heroin,” but they wouldn’t be on them as much if they had an alternative. So if the grandparent is talking to their child who’s a parent who’s worried and they don’t want them to be on the iPad all the time and they want to restrict their screen use — which a lot of parents do, understandably — the phrase that we use — Jonathan Haidt is one of the other co-founders with me of Let Grow and he also wrote The Anxious Generation — and one of the things we say is: if you want to take away the screen, you have to open the door. So opening the door becomes not just something that I think is good but it’s an alternative to the phone-based childhood that is worrisome.

**Host**: Omar B asks about how you can tell the difference between healthy independence and maybe pushing a child into a stressful situation before they’re ready. Are there some signs that we should look for in the child to know that this is the right thing you’re doing?

**Lenore**: I think everything is stressful at the beginning. It was stressful trying to set up this camera today — “Oh this is leaning this way and you look terrible and get closer.” And I mean there’s no such thing as a stress-free existence. And I think one of the things that has happened to parents is they’ve been told that their kids shouldn’t ever be frightened. You know there’s people who are against Halloween because of scary costumes. Fear and stress and a little bit of stage fright — they’re all part of everyday life in childhood and in adulthood, and that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t face them and try them. And if things turn out — so I have to tell you, independence is being used — did I tell you this already? — there’s independence therapy is a new thing, which is giving kids, as you might think, some independence to do new things if they have a diagnosis of anxiety. A professor named Camilo Ortiz at Long Island University did a pilot study where he had four families, and he talked to each of the sets of parents first and found out what was bothering them most about their kids’ behavior. And one of them was they had a nine-year-old who wouldn’t go upstairs or downstairs in his own house without a parent. And I thought that was the only family I’d ever heard of like that — and I’ve heard of other families since then. Anyways, when the next week comes for therapy the kid comes with the parents, and Camilo normally would do cognitive behavioral therapy — “I hear you’re afraid to go upstairs. How about tonight you go up for five minutes, I’ll give you a watch, you’ll time it, and then you’ll see if it was bad or good, and then we’ll try it maybe seven minutes the next week.” He doesn’t mention anything about the kid’s deficit or the parents’ worry. Instead he says “You’re nine, I’ll bet there’s some things you’re ready to do that you haven’t tried yet.” And then the kid says “Are you kidding? I want to take the Long Island Railroad, I want to walk home by myself.” And this particular kid who wanted to walk home by himself — his mom was so worried she took the day off work on the day that the first day he was walking home. Anyways, and then it got more and more normal. But one of the kids wanted to take a city bus, and she was afraid to sleep in her own bed but she was willing to take the city bus — that was something exciting for her. And when she was on the bus her phone stopped working and she was like “Oh no, where do I get off? I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.” And she was very frantic. And the lady sitting next to her saw “Is there something the matter, can I help?” And she said “Yes, I don’t know where I’m supposed to get off.” And the lady said “Well my phone works.” “Oh you missed your stop, you have to get off the next one, you got to walk back a few blocks.” And the girl said “Thank you.” And she did. And that night she slept in her own bed — which sounds like it’s too pat and perfect to be real, but it really happened. And my whole point is that psychologists believe a) that independence is important but b) messing up is great. When something goes wrong — that’s when you realize “oh I can handle this” or “that wasn’t the end of the world.” And that is very freeing. I think that’s the whole Nike idea too — “Why do it? You might mess up.” It’s like that’s okay, that’s part of the process. And once you realize that it’s not doom, it’s just a hiccup, then you are way more free. You learn by doing, by experiencing things.

**Host**: I’d love to broaden this out a little more. We definitely understand the benefits that you think exist for children and for parents to do this — and others in schools and that sort of thing — but what’s in it for everyone else? What is the benefit for the wider community, for people without children, by allowing children to have more freedom?

**Lenore**: I’m going to give you two different examples. One is the workplace. You know eventually these children go off to work, and I can’t be the only one who’s hearing the stories about young people at work being very conscientious but waiting for instructions. They’ve had so much instruction all the time that I’ve heard in schools the kids wait to fill out their name on a piece of paper — “Do I put my name on the left or the right?” I’ve heard of schools where a kid’s pencil drops to the ground and they wait for the teacher to come and pick it up or for them to be allowed to pick it up. They’re so used to being programmed that they’ve sort of lost this “go-get-’em” spirit. And that’s what we’re hearing about at work too — you have good workers but you don’t have the entrepreneurs, you don’t have this amazing American spirit of “let me try this” or “this sounds crazy but…” So in the workplace you want kids who have grown up tinkering and trying things, that when NASA had its generation of boomers retire and they had these new kids coming in — they were great on computers and great at problem sets, but if there was ever an Apollo 13 they didn’t know what to do when things went off script. So you want people who are growing up a little more scrappy, happy, a little more self-sufficient. And what else was I going to tell you — I mean I guess it’s just that God, what was I going to tell you — who is benefiting from this besides… Well one thing that’s obvious is that when you do have kids back out in the neighborhood — I don’t care if you have kids or not, I mean my kids are old — but it’s pretty sweet. You see them out there, you hear some laughter, you hear some spats — it’s just a neighborhood that comes back to life, and that’s a lot more friendly and heartwarming than a neighborhood just completely tumbleweeds up and down the block because the kids are driven and then they’re pulled into the garage and then they insert themselves into the house and it’s time for the reading log. So if only for the joy of having a very vibrant culture as opposed to a very locked-down culture — and for the parents who are just so bored driving their kids everywhere…

**Host**: You actually have influenced policy around giving kids freedom through Let Grow. In your talk you mentioned a new law, the Reasonable Childhood Independence law, that makes it legal for parents to let their kids go places alone. What more do you think we need from government and from our communities to make this cultural shift happen?

**Lenore**: Oh my, that’s like so — the laws are great, and when I gave the talk I think we had eight states had passed the Reasonable Childhood Independence law, which says that neglect is when you put your kid in obvious and serious danger, not anytime you take your eyes off them. And it’s great for the free-range parents who want their kids to be wandering around and on their bikes like Stranger Things, but it’s also great for parents living in poverty. You know if a mom is working two jobs and her kid comes home with the old-fashioned latchkey — that’s not because she’s a neglectful mom, it’s because she’s a mom who realizes “look my eight-year-old can get herself a glass of milk — or almond milk now I guess — and I can save on a babysitter.” So that shouldn’t be considered neglect either. So since the talk the law has been passed in three more states — Georgia, Florida, and Missouri — and now it’s being considered in eight more states. And maybe someday there will be federal legislation that says the same thing, which is that we don’t want the laws right now say “if you see something, say something.” And too many people don’t know what am I supposed to see and say, and it’s like they see a kid outside, sometimes they’ll call 911 because they’re just so unused to kids outside again. So if the 911 operator can say “Is the kid okay?” “Yeah they’re fine, they’re playing in the park or whatever,” that should be the end of things. It should not go from there to any kind of investigation. So that’s a great law and hopefully it will be passed in all 50 states pretty darn soon. But more generally I think we have to do this grace thing where we see kids outside and we don’t think “where’s the mom?” and we don’t think — somebody once wrote and said “Well so if your child is on a skateboard and they fall down in front of my house I have to help them.” And it’s like “Yeah you do — if you see them, if you have a band-aid, if you have a phone, you do have to help them.” And I don’t think of that as babysitting, I don’t think of that as some horrible mom who thrust her entire responsibility on you — I think of that as being part of a community. You’re at the park, a kid needs a band-aid, you give them a band-aid, not because it’s an imposition but because it’s nice. You’re nice, and it’s nice to be nice to a kid. You hope that somebody’s nice to your kid or to you when you’re older and you fall down. And so I think just giving everybody the benefit of the doubt as opposed to thinking the worst about them — that any guy at the park is a predator, any kid at the park alone is somebody who’s neglected by a terrible parent — just giving people the benefit of the doubt is just a great way to live. It makes your life more fun, it makes you see the world in a better way. And weirdly enough there was a study done of people who tell their kids “the world is dog-eat-dog place and” don’t be a “psy” and “everybody’s going to try to take advantage of you” versus “most people are decent and you can trust and default to trust.” And somehow they studied these two different groups of kids for years into their middle age and they found that the ones — the parents who raised the kids saying “everybody’s bad, beware, don’t let your guard down” — were doing it out of love, they thought they were protecting their kids, but in fact those kids in middle age had worse relationships, worse health, and less professional success. So I’m not exactly sure why but you might as well default to trust.

**Host**: It’s so interesting to think about the role that communities are playing in all of this. And we have a question from Amy S who talks about a four- and a six-year-old — she has children and how she lets her children roam outside of her home and often gets reactions from neighbors and is soon would like to see them go to the park two blocks away by themselves. And her question is whether you have thoughts on a strategy — a good strategy for a safe solo crosswalk, especially for kids on scooters — but I guess this is a question both for how parents can help their kids cross safely but also what communities can implement to make this a better experience for everyone.

**Lenore**: Well first of all I mean cars have existed for a long time. And boy in kindergarten we were taught — the school felt it incumbent upon itself to teach — look left, look right, look left again. I have no idea why we had to look left and right and left again — why don’t just look left and right and go — but I would teach them that because Mrs. Tixinsky taught me that and so far I’m alive. Crosswalks are good if you can convince a neighborhood to put one in — I guess you talk to your city council or whatever you have there. But you can’t let perfect be the enemy of the good, I guess, which is that if you have two kids together and they’re holding hands and they’re both looking left-right-left and there’s no cars coming, they’re listening for it and they’re looking for it — they’re humans, they can cross the street. One thing that Let Grow has done is that if you go to our site letgrow.org — I wish I had it with me — but we have a little card, kids can carry it with them, and it’s the Let Grow license. It says “I am not lost or neglected. My parents know I’m out here. If you don’t believe me you can call my mom.” And our old more aggressive card used to say “Call my lawyer” which a little much. But anyways it just says and it says “I know I can talk to people, I can’t go off with anyone, I’m talking to you and I’m grateful that you care that I’m safe and that’s why you’re talking to me.” So it sort of flips the person from “Where’s your mom?” to “Thank you for caring. This is the whole point — you’re an adult in the neighborhood, you’re worried for me.” That’s what I assume of most adults in the neighborhood — that they’re looking out for me as opposed to they want to throw my mom in jail. So and the other thing is going back to trying to create some kind of collective thing — either via the school or you put the notes in everybody’s mailbox — “Let’s have Free Play Fridays” and then all the kids get used to coming to the park and looking both ways and the parents get used to it too. It is cars are my least favorite thing — I’m terrified of cars — but I live in a world where there are cars. And so you know when you’ve taught your kid and you’ve watched them a couple times — you know very “step back because there’s a car a block away and they want to wait for it to get all the way across the street” and you see that they’re conscientious — I’d say by age five you can start trusting them.

**Host**: I love the idea of the cards — it feels like it’s such a smart, easy way to help this process for everyone, right? And they’re free, just download it, it’s free.

**Lenore**: Well you know, there’s so many challenges that we’re facing in this time connected to technology — the world is just changing so rapidly. What gives you hope that we can raise a generation of more confident, independent kids despite all the things going on in the world?

**Host**: I think the fact that people are recognizing — I mean really the fact that we’re talking here. I mean I’ve been trying to get a TED talk for 17 years — here it is year 17, and legitimacy shines on this message that gives me a lot of hope. I mean the fact that TED invited me to speak and then here I am again today is that for a couple years at the beginning of when I was starting my blog, the Free-Range Kids blog, I was voted by some organization the most controversial blogger in America or maybe mommy blogger, and you know I got this nickname “America’s worst mom,” and I think that people are coming to see that there’s something to trusting your kids to do more on their own — that it’s not crazy, it’s actually organic. It’s what they were — that’s why they want to explore, that’s why they go from crawling to walking — they want to do more, they want to take on the world. And that when we step back — Let Grow’s slogan is “When adults step back, kids step up.” And so that gives me hope. And TikTok for God’s sake — if it’s a trend on TikTok it must be really important.

**Host**: Well Lenore we are out of time, and I feel like we could talk for so much longer about this. There you know I have to say people always say that to me and I think they’re saying “My god she just doesn’t stop, how am I gonna get her to stop?” I’ll say “Oh we could talk but we got to say goodbye.” So truly we didn’t hit on all my questions, we didn’t hit on all of the member questions. Thank you to the members for submitting your questions — I’m sorry if we didn’t get to yours. And thank you so much Lenore for taking the time to chat with us. This has been great. And we’re excited to see more of you in the TED space.

**Lenore**: Oh my god I’m excited too. And thank you Whitney. And thank you TED.

# TED Interview: Lenore Skenazy on Free-Range Kids  
（采访者：Whitney Pennington Rodgers，嘉宾：Lenore Skenazy）

以下是将原始TED字幕整理为清晰的双人对话形式，同时保留**完整英文原文**并附上**准确中文翻译**，无任何删减。

**Whitney:**  
You actually start your talk by mentioning that you have been called America's worst mom after you let your nine-year-old ride the New York City subway alone, and you embraced that title. So while maybe not initially, um, but so I mean when you look back at that moment, what do you think struck a cultural nerve?

你在一开始演讲时提到，因为你让9岁的儿子独自搭乘纽约地铁，你被称作“美国最差劲的妈妈”，而且你后来接受了这个称号。那么回过头来看那一刻，你觉得到底是什么触动了文化的神经？

**Lenore:**  
So that he's 27 now, so I've been thinking about it for a while. And I think two things struck a nerve, because I looked at older columns of mine where I had let my kids play in the courtyard without me, I let them take elevators without me, I let them go — they're two boys — let them go to the men's room without me, obviously, and nobody cared about any of those columns.

他现在27岁了，所以我已经想这个问题很久了。我觉得触动神经的有两点。因为我翻看了以前的专栏，我写过让孩子在院子里自己玩、不陪他们坐电梯、让他们自己去男厕所（他们是两个男孩），那些文章完全没人关心。

**Lenore:**  
So I think by writing about my kid taking the subway by himself, it was basically the subway. Hey, New York City subway does not have a great reputation, and people think it's hell, and why would you send your kid down to hell, at least without you?

所以当我写孩子独自搭地铁的时候，关键就在于“地铁”。纽约地铁名声很差，大家觉得那是地狱，你为什么要让孩子一个人下地狱呢？

**Lenore:**  
And then I think it wasn't just me saying, you know, kids need independence. It was me actually doing it, pedal to the metal, and the fact that he loved it I think was also maybe just interesting. It wasn't something that we did because he should do it, he should learn, he should be toughened up. It was just he wanted to take the subway by himself and we let him. It's like, oh yeah, kids have things that they want to do on their own, and maybe we should listen to them and see what happens.

还有一点不只是我说“孩子需要独立”，而是我真的彻底放手去做，而且他特别开心，这点也很有意思。我们不是因为“他应该锻炼”“他应该学着坚强”才让他去的，只是他自己想一个人坐地铁，我们就让他去了。原来孩子有自己想做的事，也许我们应该听听看会发生什么。

**Lenore:**  
So but I think it's the subway. Yeah.

总之，我觉得主要还是“地铁”。

**Whitney:**  
Well I mean, and all these years later, it's still something that people are still, it seems like, obsessed with and concerned by this idea of letting kids go on their own. And so could you, I guess talk a little bit about this for those people who are new to your work — what exactly does “free-range kids” mean?

这么多年过去了，大家好像还是对“让孩子自己出门”这件事特别纠结、特别担心。对于还不了解你工作的人，能不能简单说说“Free-Range Kids”（放养式育儿）到底是什么意思？

**Lenore:**  
I knew you were going to ask, and frankly I've been asked this for a while and I never have a great pithy explanation, but it is basically believing that kids can do some things on their own the way most of today's parents — and certainly the grandparents — remember as kids.

我就知道你会问，这个问题我被问过无数次了，我一直没有特别简洁的答案，但核心就是：相信孩子可以自己做一些事，就像今天的大多数父母、尤其是祖辈小时候那样。

**Lenore:**  
What's strange about childhood today is the fact that kids do almost nothing on their own. And I have some statistics. We did a study with the Harris people, the Harris Poll people, and they found that the majority of kids aged 8 to 12 have rarely or never walked around their own neighborhood without an adult. More than 50% had never gone to another aisle at the grocery without an adult. 25% weren't allowed to play on their own front lawn. So it's like, why have a front lawn, you know, if kids aren't allowed there?

现在童年奇怪的地方在于，孩子几乎什么都不自己做。我们和哈里斯民调合作做过调查，8-12岁的孩子里，大多数很少或从未独自在社区里走动；超过50%从未独自去超市另一条通道拿东西；25%的孩子甚至不被允许在自家前院玩。那你要前院干嘛呢？

**Lenore:**  
Also there was this really amazing piece done in — I know it's the Daily Mail, but nonetheless — the Daily Mail did an incredible story several years back and it was called “How Children Lost the Right to Roam in Four Generations.” And it interviewed — it had a map, but it interviewed a great-grandpa, 88, how far had he gone as a kid? He'd gone six miles in any direction. And then the grandpa, 66, had gone about a mile to the fishing hole, and then the mother who was 40s had walked half a mile to school, and her son who was eight was not allowed — I can't remember if it's not allowed off his block or not allowed off his yard. But the map that showed this just showed really childhood shrinking.

《每日邮报》几年前做过一篇很棒的报道，叫《四代人如何失去自由漫步的权利》。他们采访了88岁的曾祖父，他小时候可以随便走6英里；66岁的祖父可以走到1英里外的钓鱼点；40多岁的妈妈小时候能走半英里去学校；而她8岁的儿子连街区或者自家院子都不能出。那张地图把童年的活动范围一代代缩小展示得清清楚楚。

**Lenore:**  
And Free-Range Kids is trying to make it easy, normal, and legal to widen that again, to trust kids with some independence. And that's what Let Grow, the nonprofit that grew out of Free-Range Kids, is working on.

“放养式育儿”就是要让孩子重新拥有更大的活动范围变得容易、正常、合法。我们成立的非营利组织Let Grow，就是在做这件事。

**Whitney:**  
And we'll definitely talk more about some of the work you're doing with Let Grow, but before we get into that, I'd love to just keep going on this thread around how independence for children has really begun to shrink. Why do you think modern parenting has become so focused on safety and control? This is my favorite topic, and we don't have 24 hours, we just have one.

我们待会儿一定会聊Let Grow的具体工作，但先顺着这个话题，为什么你觉得现代父母这么执着于安全和控制？

**Lenore:**  
I would say that the change really began in earnest in the 80s and into the 90s. And a couple things changed back then that were significant. One is that we got cable television in the 80s, which meant that we suddenly had a 24-hour news cycle, which had never been the case before. And of course if you have to keep people glued to the screen for all those hours, you have to find very compelling — and I would say very upsetting — content.

真正大的转变是从80年代到90年代开始的。有两件事特别关键：第一，80年代有了有线电视，24小时新闻频道出现了。想让观众一直看下去，就必须不停地播耸人听闻、让人不安的内容。

**Lenore:**  
And so that's when we started to sort of obsess about “stranger danger.” And also there were two very high-profile kidnappings in New York, my city. In 1979, a boy named Etan Patz was taken from a bus stop and never seen again… And then when it happened to Adam Walsh… there was a miniseries done on him that broke all ratings records… And when they saw that this is what really captivated audiences the most, they said, “Get me more of these.”

于是从那时起，“陌生人危险”成了全民焦虑。1979年纽约Etan Patz在公交站失踪，1981年佛罗里达的Adam Walsh在商场外被绑架，拍成的迷你剧创下收视纪录。媒体发现这种内容最能抓住观众，就不停地播类似案件。

**Lenore:**  
And we know that because to this day, Law & Order I think has been on for like 25 or 30 years… And gradually your lungs fill with this despair… 50% of parents said they were likely to be kidnapped if two 10-year-olds were playing at the park together. That's wildly out of whack with reality, thank God. But that's the result of this constant drumbeat of terror and despair that we are marinating in thanks to the media.

到现在《法律与秩序》还能播30年……我们整天被这种恐惧浸泡。哈里斯民调显示，50%的父母觉得两个10岁孩子一起在公园玩，很可能会被绑架。现实根本不是这样，但媒体的恐惧轰炸让我们相信了最坏的情况。

**Whitney:**  
So when we think about this then, now everyone has decided keep them close, don't let them roam, as you say. What are some of the hidden costs of this overprotective parenting for both parents and kids?

所以现在大家都觉得要把孩子看得死死的。那过度保护的隐形成本有哪些？

**Lenore:**  
Well let's talk about kids first… The sad thing for kids is that they are sad. They are getting anxious and depressed… One of my Let Grow co-founders is a man named Peter Gray… He did a big long study… and it showed that over the decades… as kids' independence… has gone down, their anxiety and depression have been going up. And he argues that it's not just correlation, it's causation.

对孩子来说，最可悲的是他们真的变得抑郁焦虑了。Let Grow的联合创始人Peter Gray的研究表明，过去几十年，孩子独立性越低，焦虑和抑郁就越高，而且是因果关系。

**Lenore:**  
Then you could sort of understand that because if you were in a job and you were micromanaged all the time… nobody wants to be micromanaged, and childhood has become micromanaged… There's something called an internal locus of control versus external locus of control… When you have an internal locus of control… you feel like you can handle things… We have taken most of that out of children's lives… they're like in the passenger seat of their lives while we very smart helpful people are driving them…

如果工作时有人时时刻刻管着你，你也会崩溃。童年现在就是被过度微管理。心理学上有“内在控制点”和“外在控制点”的概念，当孩子觉得自己能掌控事情时，他们会更有安全感。我们把这种感觉从孩子生活中剥夺了，他们坐在人生副驾驶，我们这些“聪明能干”的成年人替他们开着车。

**Whitney:**  
And I love in the talk… you say that “I did it myself” are both childhood's magic words and the original anxiety buster. Could you say more about that? What role does risk-taking and independence play in raising resilient children?

你在演讲里说“I did it myself”（我自己做到了）是童年最神奇的咒语，也是最早的焦虑解药。能多说说吗？冒险和独立对培养韧性有多重要？

**Lenore:**  
I'd say it plays a huge role… Something that you did yourself that you thought was a little scary or you're still proud of to this day… Their independence was just innately so important to them that they were treasuring it and protecting it… Anxiety is the opposite of that… Nike just changed its slogan… they added “Why do it?”… kids are so afraid of messing up because they're watched all the time… if Nike is recognizing a pervasive passivity in kids… then something has gone awry.

非常重要。我们小时候总有让自己害怕但做到了、到现在还骄傲的事。孩子本能地珍惜和保护自己的独立性。焦虑恰恰相反。耐克最近把“Just Do It”旁边加了一句“Why do it?”，因为孩子被盯着长大，太怕失败了，连尝试的动力都没有。

**Whitney:**  
We've set the stage now… Our member audience is so eager to hear you share more about how we actually do this… If you could just start us off with your simple small steps for how people can practically begin to give their kids more freedom without feeling reckless.

我们已经讲了很多背景，大家特别想知道具体怎么做。能不能给一些简单、不觉得太冒险的小步骤？

**Lenore:**  
First of all, it's not reckless to give your kids some freedom. I would argue that it's reckless not to… The easiest way to change anything is collectively… That's why Let Grow recommends that schools give kids a homework assignment called the Let Grow Experience… “Go home and do something new on your own with your parents' permission but without your parents.”

首先，给孩子一点自由一点都不冒险，不给才危险。改变最简单的方法是大家一起做。所以Let Grow建议学校布置一个作业叫“Let Grow Experience”：回家和父母商量，做一件以前没做过、父母不陪同的新事情。

**Lenore:**  
When you see your kid come back from that errand… Your heart grows three sizes… You almost have to let your kid go a little before you're totally ready, because you will be ready when they come home… And if they screwed up, that's okay too.

当孩子自己完成任务回来时，你的心会瞬间变大三倍。你得在自己完全准备好之前就放手，因为等他们回来，你就真的准备好了。即使他们搞砸了也没关系。

**Whitney:**  
Lorie C asks: As a single parent… what advice do you have for parents who want to give their kids more freedom but maybe feel judged by other parents or family members?

单亲家长Lorie问：想给孩子更多自由，但又怕被其他家长或家人评判，怎么办？

**Lenore:**  
Find a friend… Two women go and sit at Starbucks and they send their kids to the other end of the strip mall… Everything's more fun with a friend… All the stuff at LetGrow is free… We have “Four Weeks to a Let Grow Kid”… Another thing: Free Play Fridays… And this one mom in California started a “friendship club”… the kid has three or four doors that he can knock on anytime…

找一个志同道合的朋友。两个妈妈去星巴克，把孩子打发到商场另一头买东西。LetGrow所有资源都免费，有“四周打造放养孩子”计划。还有“自由玩耍星期五”，或者像加州一位妈妈搞的“友谊俱乐部”——孩子有三四家邻居可以随时敲门玩。

**Whitney:**  
Richard R asks: How can grandparents constructively help without undermining trust?

祖父母Richard问：怎样帮忙又不破坏父母的权威？

**Lenore:**  
Maybe you just happen to leave Peter Gray's TEDx talk lying around… If parents see that free play is actually educational… Another thing: when kids were asked… the overwhelming majority preferred free play over organized activities or screens… If you want to take away the screen, you have to open the door.

可以“不经意”地把Peter Gray关于自由玩耍的TEDx演讲放给孩子父母看。调查显示，孩子最想和朋友自由玩，其次才是课外班，最后才是上网。要减少屏幕时间，就得给他们真正的替代方案——打开家门。

**Whitney:**  
Omar B asks: How can you tell the difference between healthy independence and pushing a child into a stressful situation before they're ready?

有人问：怎么分辨是健康的独立还是把孩子推向还没准备好的压力？

**Lenore:**  
I think everything is stressful at the beginning… There's no such thing as a stress-free existence… There's independence therapy now… giving kids some independence to do new things if they have a diagnosis of anxiety… Messing up is great. When something goes wrong, that's when you realize “I can handle this.”

任何新事物开始都会有压力，生活本来就没有零压力的状态。现在甚至有“独立疗法”专门治疗焦虑症儿童——让他们去做新的事。搞砸了其实是好事，那一刻孩子会发现“我能处理”。

**Whitney:**  
What is the benefit for the wider community — for people without children — by allowing children to have more freedom?

没有孩子的成年人、整个社区能从中得到什么？

**Lenore:**  
In the workplace… we've lost this “go-get-them” spirit… NASA found new engineers didn't know what to do when things went off script… And when you do have kids back out in the neighborhood… it's pretty sweet. You hear laughter… a neighborhood that comes back to life.

职场上，现在的年轻人习惯等指令，遇到突发情况不会变通。NASA发现新一代工程师擅长标准流程，但遇到阿波罗13号那种意外就懵了。而当孩子重新出现在社区里，听到笑声、吵闹声，整个社区都活过来了。

**Whitney:**  
You have influenced policy… the Reasonable Childhood Independence Law… What more do we need from government and communities?

你们推动了“合理童年独立法”，未来还希望政府和社区做什么？

**Lenore:**  
The law says neglect is when you put your kid in obvious and serious danger, not anytime you take your eyes off them… Since the talk, three more states passed it… Maybe someday federal legislation… But more generally, we have to give everybody the benefit of the doubt… Default to trust.

法律明确：只有把孩子置于明显严重危险才算疏忽，不是你一眨眼就是疏忽。目前又有三个州通过了，希望最终全国统一。更重要的是，我们要学会给别人信任益处，默认信任。

**Whitney:**  
Amy S has 4- and 6-year-olds… wants them to go to the park two blocks away alone… any thoughts on safe solo crosswalk strategies?

一位妈妈想让4岁和6岁的孩子自己去两个街区外的公园，特别是过马路，有什么好办法？

**Lenore:**  
In kindergarten we were taught look left, look right, look left again… If you have two kids together… they can cross the street… We have a free “Let Grow License” card kids can carry… It flips the person from “Where's your mom?” to “Thank you for caring.”

幼儿园就教我们“左看右看再左看”。两个孩子一起过马路更安全。我们有免费的“Let Grow通行证”卡片，孩子带在身上，上面写着“父母知道我在外面”，把质问变成感谢。

**Whitney:**  
What gives you hope that we can raise a more confident, independent generation despite everything going on in the world?

在当下这个世界，你为什么依然乐观我们能养出更自信独立的下一代？

**Lenore:**  
The fact that people are recognizing… I've been trying to get a TED talk for 17 years — here it is, year 17… Legitimacy shines on this message… Kids want to explore. That's why they go from crawling to walking… Let Grow's slogan is: When adults step back, kids step up.

大家开始意识到这个问题了。我等了17年终于站上TED舞台，这本身就说明主流在改变。孩子天生想探索，所以他们从爬到走。Let Grow的口号是：大人退后一步，孩子向前一步。

**Whitney:**  
Lenore, we are out of time… Thank you so much… We're excited to see more of you in the TED space.

Lenore，我们时间到了。非常感谢你！期待你在TED舞台上有更多精彩分享。

**Lenore:**  
Oh my god, I'm excited too. And thank you, Whitney. And thank you, TED.

天哪，我也很激动！谢谢Whitney，谢谢TED！
