# 总结

托马斯·Y，2025届毕业生代表，在阿默斯特学院毕业典礼上发表演讲，分享了他从一个象征性绿色外卖盒中领悟到的三大人生哲理：**保持初心（“stay green”）**、**学会重新定义困难（“pickle”）**和**建立人际桥梁（“bridge”）**。他将这三大哲理视为四年大学经历的缩影，鼓励毕业生们在未来继续保持开放与好奇心，以积极态度面对挫折，并珍惜和主动构建人与人之间的连接。演讲充满个人情感与深刻反思，强调成长中的忍耐与理解，以及与社会共同体的联结对人生的重要性。

## 重点内容

- **🌱 保持初心**：像大一新生时一样积极主动与人交流，不被生活的疲惫或社交隔阂所影响。  
- **🥒 重新定义困难**：像发酵的泡菜一样，经历痛苦与困难后蜕变成长，学会正面看待失败与挫折。  
- **🃏 建立人际桥梁**：桥牌不仅是游戏，更象征人与人之间的合作与连接，是桥梁的象征。  
- **🎓 社区归属感**：阿默斯特不仅是学习的地方，更是一个提供归属感与人际网络的社区。  
- **🤝 传承与帮助**：毕业后继续指导后辈，延续阿默斯特社区的精神与人际网络。  
- **✨ 感恩之心**：对校长、学校、师长及家人的感激，感恩所有支持与帮助。  
- **🌟 探索未知**：勇于选择“少有人走的路”，保持对未来的好奇与探索精神。

## 关键见解

- **🌱 保持初心的重要性**  
  托马斯指出，许多学生在大学期间逐渐失去大一时的单纯与主动。保持“绿色”态度意味着持续开放与好奇，主动建立联系。这不仅促进社交，还能塑造积极的生活态度。在快速变化的现代社会，保持初心有助于持续学习与成长。

- **🥒 挫折是成长的必经之路**  
  通过“泡菜”发酵的比喻，托马斯提醒大家，人生中的痛苦与不适是暂时的，是成长的必要阶段。成功往往建立在失败与痛苦之上，尤其在青春期和青年早期，学会正面看待困境是心理韧性的体现。

- **🃏 人际关系中的“桥梁”作用**  
  桥牌不仅是托马斯的兴趣，更为他开启了跨代、跨文化的沟通窗口，带来意想不到的智慧。这启示我们主动构建“桥梁”，连接不同人群，拓展视野，建立支持系统。

- **🎓 社区归属感的持续价值**  
  阿默斯特作为一个社区，不仅提供知识与技能，还赋予学生归属感与支持感。毕业不是结束，而是成为社区更广泛联系的一部分，这种归属感对职业发展和心理健康有积极影响。

- **🤝 成为导师、传承帮助**  
  毕业生作为“前辈”，应积极帮助学弟学妹及职场新人，形成良性循环。这种传承不仅帮助他人，也提升自身的责任感与影响力。

- **✨ 感恩与认同的重要性**  
  托马斯对校长、教授、家人的感谢体现成功背后集体支持的力量。感恩增强集体意识与个人谦逊，有助于建立积极人际关系。

- **🌟 勇于走未选择的路**  
  引用罗伯特·弗罗斯特的名句，托马斯鼓励大家勇于选择“少有人走的路”，拥抱不确定性与探索精神。在多样化的现代职业与人生路径中，敢于选择非传统道路体现个性发展与创新精神。

## 总结思考

托马斯的三大人生哲学不仅适用于毕业季，也适合任何处于转折期的人。他的演讲从个人经验出发，结合普遍人生法则，为毕业生提供了深具启发性的思考框架，具有重要的现实指导意义，展现了年轻人在面对挑战时应有的态度与智慧。

# 讲话稿

It is now my pleasure to introduce the senior chosen by the class of 2025 to address you this morning, Thomas Y, who graduates today with a double major in mathematics and political science.

Tom [Applause] Thank you. I have to make a confession. I stole something from Ammerst and never gave it back. I've kept it for four years and it's followed me across dorms and semesters. I have to come clean. I stole a green to-go box. Remember these? For those of you who don't know, Ammerst bought these during co to encourage eating outside our dining hall. They were a symbol of convenience, avoidance, stench. Then suddenly they were gone. Ask anyone from the class of 2026 onwards and they'll have no idea what we're talking about. But we remember. Some of you might remember these green boxes as an unwelcome COVID reminder. But I see something different. A philosophy. Because inside this box are three important lessons that I'm taking to go. 

Lesson one, stay green. And I don't just mean eco-friendly green. Remember how green and naive we were freshman year? How in our first month at Ammerst, we'd sit next to anyone in the Val tents. No hesitation, no awkwardness, just, "Hey, mind if I join you?" Then for 4 years, we've collectively forgotten how to do that and refused to say hi even when we know someone. Yeah, I'm looking at you, Casey. Why won't you say hi to me? I've noticed this month that a lot of us have suddenly remembered because the end is near. Why did we wait? I wish we all stayed green and channeled the spirit of freshman year more. Look, I know it's hard to stay that optimistic. We as a class have been through a lot together. We've survived a global health pandemic. We've witnessed a war in Ukraine. And we've experienced a huge presidential transition. I mean, when President Elliot came in and took over from Biddy Martin, everyone was up in arms. Ah, another straight white guy. He smiles too much. And why is he lurking at the rave? At first, I was skeptical, too. But I've come to realize that what unsettles us about our friendly neighborhood president is just that he's stayed green. He's embodied the best parts of freshman year, saying hi to everyone, going to every event on campus, and getting himself into a lot of awkward conversations. I've seen this friendly greenness in a few others. Renee, who brightens everyone's meal as we enter Val, math professor Contreres, who sits with anyone for breakfast, and future CEO of LinkedIn, Da Manni, who will help anyone with their homework at midnight. What do they all have in common? They kept their greenness. Look, I'm not telling you all to backtrack to freshman year, but let's move forward and not leave behind openness and curiosity. Be intentionally green moving forward. When you walk by a stranger, say hello and look at them, not at your phone. When your friends want to make plans, take it out of the group chat and make it happen. And let's not wait until our 50-year reunion to finally talk to that Ammeris classmate you wanted to talk to. It's hard, I know. But that's why we need to be intentional about it. We've left behind many things from freshman year we don't want to see again. Masks, nose swabs, and three times Grammy award-winning artist. Common, but let's stay green. 

Lesson two. Pickle. Pickles teach us a lot about how to frame our lives because fermentation shows us that in the moment some things look and smell really bad, but give it time and you get something pretty good like pickles, kombucha, or [Laughter] kids. Embrace the rotten because sometimes a horrible process is what makes us better. And you can only see that in hindsight. So reframe things the next time something doesn't go your way. When you're suffering through the last weeks of your thesis, you're not just in pain, you're becoming a scholar. When you get a B+ in beginner ballet like I did, you're not just failing, you're pushing your comfort zones. And when housing forces you to move into a Cohen double or forced triple point is no matter what you're facing, a tough assignment, an embarrassing moment, or just bad luck, those things are miserable. How are you going to deal with it? Reframe it. Remember pickles. Embrace the painful and rotten. My family faced one of these very painful moments last summer with a brain cancer diagnosis. Dad, you've beaten the odds and I'm so thankful that you're here [Music] today. At the time, your sickness was one of the most rotten things I've ever experienced. But looking back, that time brought our family closer together than ever. I learned not to hold back my gratitude, my words, or my love. Despite the pain, we all became stronger. We reframed the rotten as growth. The confidence I've grown into this year hasn't come from success. It's come from surviving this hardship and failure. Many times I felt down. I was actually on my way up. So in these first postgrad years, you're going to be tempted to compare your success to others. But fermentation takes time. So will your success. I hope you're lucky enough to not always succeed immediately, lucky enough to sometimes fail, and wise enough to wait for the process to finish. The process stinks. Sometimes it feels like you're going to run in circles for no reason at all, but that's when real real progress happens. I did track and field. You can trust me. Be patient. Life's a dream, but sometimes it's first a pickle. 

Lesson three. Bridge. Bridge is a card game that I've played every Sunday since coming to Ammerst. I've played with a lot of seniors and not just my classmates because when I say I play bridge, people usually go, "Oh, my grandma plays that." So, how did I get involved with a hobby of the Margarets and Gertudes of the world? I started the way many college activities do, hanging out with your friends. Unlike most activities, I got involved because Big Mike bribed me during orientation week. He said I could get paid to learn a dying card game. So on Sunday, I showed up to North Common Room at 4 p.m. No questions asked. Now, I hated Bridge at first. It's a tough game to learn. You sit at a table and play as a partnership with the person across from you. Lots of rules, lots of teamwork, and lots of frustration.But when the $15 hit my Venmo the next day, unemployed freshman me reconsidered. So my friends and I kept showing up week after week to get paid and learn how to play bridge. Before long, we loved the card game itself, founded the Amoris Bridge Club, and began traveling to tournaments across the world, meeting tons of new people. Full disclosure, we don't pay you to play bridge anymore. So, I know it's a tough cell, but even if you don't start playing bridge, I hope you'll remember bridges because the unexpected gift of bridge has been the connections it's built me. Bridges that span generations and geographies. Bridge isn't just a card game. It's about partnership. We share strategies with each other, yes, but also stories and life lessons. Each table I've played at is a new conversation and lets me glimpse different life paths. I've played with Jeff, a 40-year-old Canadian teacher, Zeia, an 80-year-old Pakistani Grandmaster, Bill, a retired biologist, and even Bill Gates. Many friendships I've made through Bridge wouldn't have existed if I didn't seek out this connection. So find mentors, learn who to trust, because not all advice is worth taking. Not all advice is worth taking. If you don't believe me, you're already doing a great job. No one does life alone, so lean on our Ammeris community. Some of my earliest life advice came from alums who I reached out to. Mike Reed, class of '04. AJ Chiansi and Ryan Park05, Harran Tong, 2023, and many, many more. These alums responded to emails from some green freshman who knew nothing about a career in law. And they spent hours conversing with me. They built me a bridge. Bridges go two ways. What bridge will you build for someone else? In just a few minutes, you'll also be an alum who can start building bridges for others. Take some time to mentor the interns at work or respond to that amorous freshman who emails you because you never know, you might get a shout out at their commencement. Look to receive and create bridges. For me, it started with a silly little card game, bridge. Find your bridge and pay it forward.

It's finally time I give my stolen box back. But before I do, seniors, take a moment to ask yourself, what will you take away from your time at Ammerst? And what will you give back to others in life after Ammerst? It might take a while to answer that. So remember, Ammerst isn't going to be just one time or place in our lives. It's going to be an eternal community of friends and a lifelong of explaining that no, we're different from UMass Ammerst. When our parents first sent us here, I'm sure that they hoped we'd become less naive and maybe figure out a life plan. But I hope we leave just as green and still a little uncertain about our road ahead. Because as the poet who we named our kind of ugly Frost Library after once said, "Two roads diverged. I chose the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference." I hope you choose the roads not taken. I hope you hold on to your greenness and the things many others would leave behind because some of those things, like green to-go boxes, are actually worth keeping around. So before I end, I want to thank President Elliot, the board of trustees, professors, and all members of the college. You've truly made Ammeris special, and it's been an honor to speak today. Thank you families for coming all this way. While other commencements get Nobel Prize winners and Kermit the Frog, you got me finally. Thank you and congratulations. Seniors, it was a pleasure to be young with you. As we depart, let's keep these three green box lessons in mind. Build bridges, embrace the rotten, and bring our freshman greenness to Heat. Heat.
