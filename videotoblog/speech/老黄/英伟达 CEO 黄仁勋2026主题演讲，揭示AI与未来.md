Welcome to the stage, Nvidia founder and CEO, Jensen Wong.
Hello, Las Vegas. Happy New Year.
Welcome to CES. Well, we have about 15 kilos worth of
material to pack in here. I'm so happy to see all of you. You got 3,000 people in this auditorium. There's 2,000 people
in a courtyard watching us. There's another thousand people apparently in the fourth floor where there were
supposed to be Nvidia show floors all watching this keynote and of course millions around the world are going to
be watching this to kick off this new year. Well, every 10 to 15 years the
computer industry resets. A new platform shift happens
from mainframe to PC, PC to internet, internet to cloud, cloud to mobile. Each
time the world of applications target a new platform, that's why it's
called a platform shift. You write new applications for a new computer.
Except this time there are two simultaneous platform shifts in fact happening at the same
time. While we now move to AI, applications
are now going to be built on top of AI. At first people thought AIs are applications and in fact AIs are
applications but you're going to build applications on top of AIS
but in addition to that how you run the software how you develop
the software fundamentally changed. The entire fabulary stack of the computer industry
is being reinvented. You no longer program the software, you
train the software. You don't run it on CPUs, you run it on GPUs.
And whereas applications were pre-recorded, pre-ompiled
and run on your device, now applications understand the context and generate
every single pixel, every single token completely from scratch every single time.
Computing has been fundamentally reshaped as a result of accelerated computing, as a result of artificial
intelligence. Every single layer of that five layer cake is now being re
reinvented. Well, what that means is some 10 trillion dollars or so of the last
decade of computing is now being modernized to this new way of doing computing. What that means is hundreds
of billions of dollars, a couple hundred billion dollars in VC funding each year is going into modernizing and inventing
this new world. And what it means is a hundred trillion dollars of industry,
several percent of which is R&D budget is shifting over to artificial intelligence. People ask where is the
money coming from? That's where the money is coming from. the modernization of AI to AI, the shifting of R&D budgets
from classical methods to now artificial intelligence methods, enormous amounts
of investments coming into this industry, which explains why we're so busy. And this last year was no
difference. This last year was incredible. This last year, there's a slide coming.
This is what happens when you don't practice. This is the first keynote of the year. I
hope it's your first keynote of the year. Otherwise, you can you have been pretty pretty busy. It's our first keynote of the year. We're going to get
the spiderwebs out. And so 2025 was an
incredible year. It's just see it seemed like everything was happening all at the same time. And
it in fact it probably was. The first thing of course is scaling loss.
In 2015, the first language model that I thought
was really going to make a difference made a huge difference. It was called BERT. 2017, Transformers came. It wasn't
until 5 years later, 2022, that chat GPT moment happened and it awakened the
world to the possibilities of artificial intelligence. Something very important happened a year
after that. The first 01 model from chat GPT the first reasoning model completely
revolutionary invented this idea called test time scaling which is very common sens common sensical thing not only do
we pre-train a model to learn we postrain it with our re reinforcement learning so that it could learn skills
and now we also have test time scaling which is another way of saying thinking you think in real time each one of these
phases of artificial intelligence requires enormous amount of comput and the computing law continued to scale.
Large language models continued to get better. Meanwhile, another breakthrough happened and this breakthrough happened
in 2024. Agentic systems started to emerge in 2025. It started to pervase to to uh
proliferate just about everywhere. Agentic models that have the ability to reason,
look up information, do research, use tools, plan futures, simulate outcomes.
All of a sudden started to solve very very important problems. One of my favorite Agentic models is called cursor
which revolutionized the way we do software programming at NVIDIA. Agentic systems are going to really take off
from here. Of course, there were other types of AI. We know that large language models isn't the only type of
information. Wherever the universe has information, wherever the universe has structure, we could teach a large
language model a form of language model to go understand that information to
understand its representation and to turn that into an AI. One of the biggest
most important one is physical AI. AIs that understand the laws of nature. And
then of course physical AI is about AIs interacting with the world but the world
itself has information encoded information and that's called AI physics. AI that in the case of physical
AI you have AI that interacts with the physical world and you have AI physics AI that understands the laws of physics.
And then lastly one of the most important things that happened last year the advancement of open models. We can
now know that AI is going to proliferate everywhere when open source when open
innovation when innovation across every single company and every industry around the world is activated. At the same
time, open models really took off last year. In fact,
last year we saw the advance of DeepSeek R1, the first open model that's a
reasoning system. It caught the world by surprise and it activated literally this
entire movement. Really, really exciting work. We're so happy with it. Now we
have openings open model systems all over the world of all different kinds and we now know that open models have
also reached the frontier. still solidly is six months behind the frontier models
but every single six months a new model is emerging and these models are getting
smarter and smarter because of that you could see the number of downloads has
exploded the number of downloads is growing so fast because startups want to
participate in the AI revolution large companies want to researchers want to students want to just about every single
country wants How is it possible that intelligence, the digital form of intelligence will
leave anyone behind and so open models has really revolutionized artificial
intelligence last year. This entire industry is going to be reshaped as a result of that. Now, we had this inkling
some time ago. You might have heard that several years ago, we started to build
and operate our own AI supercomputers. We call them DGX clouds. A lot of people
asked, are you going to in going into the cloud business? The answer is no. We're building these DGX supercomputers
for our own use. Well, it turns out we have billions of dollars of supercomputers in operation so that we
could develop our open models. I am so pleased with the work that we're doing.
It is starting to attract attention all over the world and all over the industries because we are doing frontier
AI model work in so many different domains. the work that we did in proteins in digital biology. La Protina
to be able to synthesize and generate proteins. Open F3 to understand the
understand the structure of proteins. EVO 2 how to understand and generate
multiple proteins otherwise the beginnings of cellular cellular representation. Earth 2 AI that
understands laws of physics. The work that we did with forecast net, the work that we did with Cordiff really
revolutionized the way that people are doing weather prediction. Neotron,
we've now doing groundbreaking work there. The first hybrid transformer SSM
model that's incredibly fast can and therefore can think for a very long time
or can think very quickly with that for not a very long time and produce very very smart intelligent answers.
Neimotron 3 is groundbreaking work and you can expect us to deliver other versions of Neimotron 3 in the near
future. Cosmos a frontier open world foundation model
one that understand how the world works. Groot a humanoid robotic system
articulation mobility locomotion. These models, these technologies are now being
integrated and in the each one of these cases open to the world. Frontier human
or robotics models open to the world. And then today we're going to talk a little bit about Alpamo, the work that
we've been doing in self-driving cars. Not only do we open source the models,
we also open source the data that we use to train those models because that in
that way only in that way can you truly trust how the models came to be. We open
source all the models. We help you make derivatives from them. We have a whole suite of libraries we call the Nemo
libraries, physics li physics nemo libraries and the clarono libraries. Each biono libraries each one of these
libraries are life cycle management systems of AIS so that you could process the data you could generate data you
could train the model you could create the model evaluate the model guardrail the model all the way to deploying the
model each one of these libraries are incredibly complex and all of it is open
sourced and so now on top of this platform NVIDIA is a frontier AI model
builder and we build it in a very special way. We build it completely in the open so that we can enable every
company, every industry, every country to be part of this AI revolution. I'm
incredibly proud of the work that we're doing there. In fact, if you notice the tren the charts, the chart shows that
our contribution to this industry is bar none and you're going to see us in fact continue to do that if not accelerate.
These models are also world class. All systems are down.
This never happens in Santa Clara. Is it because of Las Vegas?
Somebody must have went won a jackpot outside. All systems are down.
Okay, I think my system's still down, but that's okay. I I I've I uh I'll make
it up as I go. And so so uh not only are these models uh frontier capable, not
only are they open, they're also top the leaderboards. This is an area where we're very proud. They top leaderboards
in intelligence. Uh we have uh uh important models that understand multimodality documents, otherwise known
as PDFs. The most valuable content in the world are captured in PDFs. But
there it takes artificial intelligence to find out what's inside, interpret what's inside, and help you read it. And
so our PDF retrievers, our PDF parsers are worldclass.
Our speech recognition models absolutely worldclass. Our retrieval models, basically search, semantic search, AI
search, the database engine of the modern AI era, worldclass. So we're on
top of leaderboards constantly. This is an area we're very proud of and all of that is in service of your ability to
build AI agents. This is really a groundbreaking area of development. You
know at first when pe when chat GPT came out people said you know uh gosh it it
produced really interesting results but it hallucinated greatly. And the reason why it hallucinated, of course, it could
memorize everything um in the past, but it can't memorize everything in the future, in the current. And so it needs
to be grounded in research. It has to do fundamental research before it answers a
question. The ability to reason about do I have to do research? Do I have to use tools? How do I break up a problem into
steps? Each one of these steps something that that the AI model knows how to do.
And together it is able to compose it into a sequence of steps to perform something it's never done before, never
been trained to do. This is the wonderful capability of reasoning. We could we could be we can encounter a
circumstance we've never seen before and break it down into circumstances and
knowledge or rules that we know how to do because we've experienced it in the
past. And so the ability for AI models now to be able to reason incredibly powerful.
The reasoning capability of agents opened the doors to all of these different applications. We no longer
have to train an AI model to know everything on day one. Just as we don't
have to know everything on day one, that we should be able to in every circumstance reason about how to solve
that problem. Large language models has now made this fundamental leap. The
ability to use reinforcement learning and chain of thought and you know search and planning and all these different
techniques in reinforcement learning has made it possible for us to have this basic capability and is also now
completely open sourced. But the thing that's really terrific is another breakthrough that happened and the first
time I saw it was with Arvin's perplexity. Perplexity, the search
company, the AI search company, really f really innovative company. And the first time I realized they were using multiple
models at the same time, I thought it was completely genius. Of course, we would do that. Of course, an AI would
also call upon all of the world's great AIs to solve the problem it wants to solve at any part of the reasoning
chain. And this is the reason why AIs are really multi-modal
meaning they understand speech and images and text and videos and 3D
graphics and proteins. It's multimodal. It's also multi-model
meaning that it should be able to use any model that best fits the task. It is
multicloud by definition. Therefore, because these AI models are sitting in all these different places and it also
is hybrid cloud because if you're an enterprise company or you've built a robot or whatever that device is,
sometimes it's at the edge, sometimes a radio cell tower, maybe sometimes it's in an enterprise or maybe it's a place
where a hospital where you need to have the the data in real time right next to
you. Whatever those applications are, we know now this is what an AI application
looks like in the future. Or another way to think about that because future
applications are built on AIS. This is the basic framework of future
applications. This basic framework, this basic structure of agentic AIs that could do
the things that I'm talking about that is multi-model has now turbocharged
AI startups of all kinds. And now you can also because of the all of the open
models and all the tools that we provided you, you could also customize your AIs to teach your AI skills that
nobody else is teaching. Nobody else is causing their AI to become intelligent or smart in that way. You could do it
for yourself. And that's the work that we do with Neimotron, Nemo, and all of the things that we do with open models
is intended to do. You put a smart router in front of it. And that router is essentially a manager that decides
which one of the task based on the intention of the prompts that you give it, which one of the models is best fit
for that application for that solving that problem. Okay. So now when you
think about this architecture, what do you have? When you think about this architecture,
all of a sudden you have an AI that's on the one hand completely customizable by
you. Something that you could teach to do your own very skills for your company. Something that's domain secret,
something where you have deep domain expertise. Maybe you've got all of the data that you need to train that AI
model. On the other hand, your AI is always at the frontier by definition.
You're always at the frontier. On the one hand, you're always customized. On the other hand, it should just run. And
so, we thought we would make the simplest of examples to make it available to you. This entire framework
we call a blueprint and we have blueprints that are integrated into enterprise SAS platforms all over the
world and we're really pleased with the progress. But what we do is show you a a short example of something that anybody
can do. Let's build a personal assistant.
I wanted to help me with my calendar, emails, to-do lists, and even keep an eye on my home. I use Brev to turn my
DGX Spark into a personal cloud. So, I can use the same interface whether I'm using a cloud GPU or a DGX Spark. I use
a Frontier model API to easily get started.
I want him to help me with my emails, so I create an email tool for my agent to call.
I want my emails to stay private, so I'll add an open model that's running locally on the Spark.
Now, for any job, I want the agent to use the right model for the right task. So, I'll use an intentbased model
router. This way, prompts that need email will stay on my Spark, and everything else
can call the Frontier model. I want my assistant to interact with my world, so I'll hook it up to Hugging Faces Reachi
mini robot. My agent controls the head, ears, and camera of the Reachi with tool calls. I
want to give Reichi a voice, and I really like 11 Labs, so I'll hook up their API. Hi, I'm Reachi running on DGX Spark.
Hey Richi, what's on my to-do list today? your to-do list today.
Grab groceries, eggs, milk, butter, and send Jensen the new script.
Okay, let's send Jensen an update. Tell him we'll have it for him by the end of the day. We'll do.
Richi, there's a sketch, too. Can you turn it into an architectural rendering? Sure.
Nice. Now make a video and show me around the room.
Here you go. That's great. With Brev, I can share access to my
Spark and Reachi, so I'm going to share it with Anna. Hey Richi, what's Potato up to?
He's on the couch. I remember you don't like this. I'll tell him to get off. Potato, off the
couch. With all the progress in open source, it's incredible to see what you can build. I'd love to see what you create.
Isn't that incredible? Now, the amazing thing is that is
utterly trivial now. That is utterly trivial now. And yet, just a couple
years ago, all of that would have been impossible. Absolutely unimaginable. Well, this basic framework, this basic
way of building applications using language models
using language models. Using language models using language
models that are pre-trained and they're proprietary, they're frontier. combine
it with customized language models into a aentic framework, a reasoning
framework that allows you to access tools and files and maybe even connect
to other agents. This is basically the architecture of AI
applications or applications in the modern age and the ability for us to create these applications are incredibly
fast. And notice if you give it this application um
information that it's never seen before or in a structure that has is not
represented exactly as you thought it can still reason through it and make its
best effort to reason through the data the information to try to understand how to solve the problem artificial
intelligence. Okay. So this basic framework is now being integrated and and everything that I just described. We
had the benefit of working with some of the world's leading enterprise platform companies. Uh Palunteer for example
um their their entire AI and data processing platform is being integrated
accelerated by NVIDIA today. Service Now the world's leading customer service and
um employee service platform. Snowflake the world's top data platform in the
cloud. uh incredible work that that uh is being done there. Uh Code Rabbit,
we're using Code Rabbit all over Nvidia. Uh Crowdstrike creating AIs to detect to
find AI threats. Uh NetApp, their AI, their data platform now has NVIDIA's
semantic AI on top of it and agentic systems on top of it uh uh to for uh for
them to do customer service. But the important thing is this. Not only is this the way that you develop applications now, this is going to be
the user interface of your platform. So whether it's Palanteer or Service Now or
Snowflake and many other companies that we're working with, the agentic system
is the interface. It's no longer Excel with a bunch of, you know, squares that
you enter enter information into. Maybe it's no longer could just command line. the any all of that multimodality
information is now possible and the way you interact with your platform is much
more well if you will simple like you're interacting with people and so that's
enterprise AI being revolutionized by angentic systems the next thing is
physical AI this is an area that you've seen me talk about for several years in fact we've been working on this for
eight years the question is how do you take something that is intelligent
inside a computer and interacts with you with screens and speakers to something
that can interact with the world. Meaning it can understand the common sense of how the world works. Object
permanence. If I look away and I look back, that object is still there. Um causality. If I push it, it tips over.
It understands friction and gravity. It understands inertia. that a heavy truck
rolling down the road is going to need a little bit more time to stop, that a
ball is going to keep on rolling. These ideas are common sense to even a
little child, but for AI, it's completely unknown. And so we have to
create a system that allows AIS to learn the the common sense of the physical world, learn its laws, but also to be
able to of course learn from data and the data is quite scarce and to be able to evaluate whether that AI is working,
meaning it has to simulate in an environment. How does an AI know that
the the actions that it's performing is consistent with what it should do if it doesn't have the ability to simulate the
response of the physical world back on its actions. The response of its actions is really important to simulate
otherwise there's no way to evaluate it. It's different every time. And so this basic system requires three computers.
One computer of course the one that we know that Nvidia builds for training the AI models. Another computer that we know
is to inference the computer. Inference the models. Inferencing the model is essentially a robotics computer that
runs in a car or runs in a robot or runs in a factory, runs anywhere at the edge. But there has to be another computer
that's designed for simulation and simulation is at the heart of almost everything Nvidia does. This is this is
where we are most comfortable and simulation was really the foundations of
almost everything that we've done with physical AI. So we have three computers and multiple stacks that run on these
computers, these libraries to make them useful. Omniverse is our digital twin physically based simulation world.
Cosmos as I mentioned earlier is our foundation model not a foundation model for language but a foundation model of
the world. and is also aligned with language. You could say something like, you know,
what's happening to the ball and they they'll tell you the ball's rolling down the street. And so a world foundation
model and then of course the robotics models. We have two of them. One of them is called Groot. The other one's called
Alpamo that I'm going to tell you about. Now the one of the most important things that we have to do with physical AI is
to create the data to train the AI in the first place. Where does that data come from? rather than instead of having
languages because we created a bunch of text that are what we consider ground
truth that the AI can learn from. How do we teach an AI the ground truth of physics? There lots and lots of videos,
lots and lots of videos, but hardly enough to capture the diversity and the type of interactions that we need. And
so this is where great minds came together and transformed
what used to be compute into data. Now using synthetic data generation that is
grounded and conditioned by the laws of physics, grounded and conditioned by
ground truth, we can now selectively cleverly generate data that we can then
use to train the AI. So for example, what comes into this AI, this Cosmos AI
world model on the left on over here is the output of a traffic simulator.
Now this traffic simulator is hardly enough for an AI to learn from. We can take this, put it into a
Cosmos foundation model and generate surround video that is physically based
and physically plausible that the AI can now learn from. And there are so many
examples of this. Let me show you what Cosmos can do.
The chat GPT moment for physical AI is nearly here, but the challenge is clear.
The physical world is diverse and unpredictable. Collecting real world training data is
slow and costly and it's never enough. The answer is synthetic data. It starts
with NVIDIA Cosmos, an open Frontier World Foundation model for physical AI
pre-trained on internet scale video, real driving and robotics data, and 3D
simulation. Cosmos learned a unified representation of the world, able to align language,
images, 3D, and action. It performs physical AI skills like
generation, reasoning, and trajectory prediction from a single image. Cosmos generates
realistic video from 3D scene descriptions, physically
coherent motion, from driving telemetry and sensor logs,
surround video from planning simulators,
multi- camera environments, or from scenario prompts. It brings edge
cases to life. Developers can run interactive closed loop simulations in Cosmos. When actions
are made, the world responds. Cosmos reasons.
It analyzes edge scenarios, breaks them down into familiar physical interactions, and reasons about what
could happen next. Cosmos turns compute into data, training
AVs for the longtail and robots how to adapt for every scenario.
I know it's incredible. Cosmos is the world's leading foundation
model. World foundation model. It's been downloaded millions of times, used all over the world, getting world getting
the world ready for this new era of physical AI. We use it ourselves as well. We use it ourselves to create our
self-driving car. using it for scenario generation and
using it for evaluation. We could have something that allows us to effectively travel billions,
trillions of miles, but doing it inside a computer. And we've made enormous
progress. Today, we're announcing Alpio, the world's first
thinking reasoning autonomous vehicle AI. Alpo is
trained end to end. Literally from camera in to actuation out. The camera
in lots and lots of miles that are driven by itself where we human drive it dri using human
demonstration and we have lots and lots of miles that are generated by cosmos. In addition to
that, hundreds of thousands of examples are labeled very very carefully so that
we could teach the car how to drive. Alpha Mayo does something that's really special. Not only does it take sensor
input and activates steering wheel, brakes and and acceleration, it also
reasons about what action it is about to take. It tells you what action it's
going to take. the reasons by which it came about that action and then of course the trajectory.
All of these are coupled directly and trained very specifically by a large
combination of human trained and as well as Cosmos generated data. The result of
it is just really incredible. Not only does your car drive as you would expect it to drive and it drives so naturally
because it learned directly from human demonstrators but in every single scenario when it comes up to the
scenario it reasons about it tells you what it's going to do and it reasons about what you what's about to do. Now
the reason why this is so important is because of the long tale of driving there. It's impossible for us to simply
collect every single possible scenario for everything that could ever happen in every single country in every single
circumstance that's possibly ever going to happen for all of population.
However, it is very unlikely. It's very likely that every scenario if decomposed
into a whole bunch of other smaller scenarios are quite normal for you to understand. And so these long tails will
be decomposed into quite normal circumstances that the card knows how to deal with. It just needs to reason about
it. And so let's take a look. Everything you're about to see is one shot. It's a no hands.
Routing to your destination. Buckle up.
Heat.
Heat. Heat. Heat.
Heat. Heat.
Heat. Heat.
Heat. Heat.
Heat. Heat.
You have arrived.
We started working on self-driving cars eight years ago. And the reason for that is because we reason early on that deep
learning and artificial intelligence was going to reinvent the entire computing stack. And if we were ever going to
understand how to navigate ourselves and how to guide the industry towards this
new future, we have to get good at building the entire stack. Well, as I
mentioned earlier, AI is a five layer cake. The lowest layer is land power and
shell. In the case of robotics, the lowest layer is the car. The next layer above it is chips, GPUs, networking
chips, CPUs, all that kind of stuff. The next layer above that is the infrastructure.
That infrastructure in this particular case as I mentioned with physical AI is omniverse and cosmos.
And then above that are the models. And in the case of the models above that I
just shown you. The model here is called Alpha Mayo. And
Alpha Mayo today is open sourced. We this incredible body of work. It took
several thousand people. Our AV team is several thousand people. Just to put in perspective, our partner uh Ola, I think
Ola's here in the audience somewhere. Uh Mercedes agreed to partner with us five
years ago to go make all of this possible. We imagine that someday a
billion cars on a road will all be autonomous. You could either have it be a robo taxi that you're you're you're
orchestrating and and renting from somebody or you could own it and is driving for driving by itself or you
could decide to drive for yourself and so but every single car will have autonomous vehicle capability. Every
single car will be AI powered and so the the the model layer in this case is
Alpha Mayo and the application above that is the Mercedes-Benz. Okay. And so, so this entire stack is
our first Nvidia first entire stack endeavor and we've been working on it for this entire time and I'm just so
happy that the first AV car from Nvidia is going to be on the road in Q1 and
then it goes Europe in Q2 here in the United States in Q1 then Europe in Q2 and I think it's Asia in Q3 and Q4 and
the powerful thing is that we're going to keep on updating it with next ver next versions of alpha Mayo and versions
after that. There's no question in my mind now that this is going to be one of the largest robotics industries and I'm
so happy that we worked on it and it taught us enormous amount about how to help the rest of the world build robotic
systems. That deep understanding in knowing how to build it ourselves, building the entire infrastructure
ourselves and knowing what kind of chips a robotic system would would need. In this partic particular case, dual Orins,
the next generation dual Thors. These processors are designed for robotic
systems and was designed for the safe highest level of safety capability. This
car just got rated. It just went to production. The Mercedes-Benz CLA was
just rated by NCAP, the world's safest car.
It is the only system that I know that has every single line of code, the chip,
the system, every line of code safety certified. The entire model system is
based on a sensors are diverse and redundant and so is the self-driving car
stack. The Alpha Mayo stack is trained end to end and has incredible skills.
However, nobody knows until you drive it forever that it's going to be perfectly safe.
And so that we the way we guard rail that is with another software stack, an entire AV stack underneath. That entire
AV stack is built to be fully traceable and it's taken us some five years to
build that some six, seven years actually to build that second stack. These two software stacks are mirroring
each other and then we have a policy and safety evaluator decide is this something that I'm very confident and
can reason about driving very safely. If so, I'm going to have Alpamo do it. If it's a circumstance that I'm not very
confident in and the safety um policy evaluator decide that we're going to go
back to a a very a simpler, safer guard rail system, then it goes back to the classical AV stack. where the only car
in the world with both of these AV stacks running and all safety systems should have diversity and redundancy.
Well, our vision is that someday every single car, every single truck will be autonomous. And we've been working
towards that future. This entire stack is vertically integrated. Of course, in the case of Mercedes-Benz, we built the
entire stack together. We're going to deploy the car. We're going to operate the stack. We're going to maintain the stack for as long as we shall live.
However, like everything else we do as a company, we build the entire stack, but
the entire stack is open for the ecosystem. And these the ecosystem working with us to build L4 and robo
taxis is expanding and it's going everywhere. I fully expect this to be well this is
already a giant business for us. It's a giant business for us because they use it for training our training data,
processing data and training their models. They use it for synthetic data generation in some cases. In some car,
in some companies, they pretty much just build uh the computers, the chips that are inside the car. And some companies
work with us full stack. Some companies work with us some partial part of that. Okay. So, it doesn't matter uh how much
you decide to use. You know, my only request is use a little bit of video wherever you can and uh you know, but uh
the entire thing is open. Now this is going to be the first largecale
mainstream um AI physical AI market and this is now I think we can all agree
fully here and this inflection point of going from not autonomous vehicles to
autonomous vehicles is probably happening right about this time in in the next 10 years I'm fairly certain a
very very large percentage of the world's cars will be autonomous or highly autonomous but this This basic
technique that I just described in using the three computers using synthetic data generation and simulation applies to
every form of robotic systems. It could be a robot that is just an articulator, a manipulator, maybe it's a mobile
robot, maybe it's a fully humanoid robot. And so the next journey,
the next era for robotic systems is going to be, you know, robots. And these
robots are going to come in all kinds of different sizes. And and uh I invited some friends. Did they come?
Hey guys, hurry up. I got a lot of stuff to cover.
Come on, hurry. Did you tell R2-D2 you were going to be
here? Did you? And C3PO.
Okay. All right. Come here. Before now, one of the things that one of the things that's really You have Jetson's. They
have little Jetson computers inside them. They're trained inside Omniverse.
And how about this? Let's show everybody the simulator that you were that you guys learned how to how to be robots in.
You You guys want to look at that? Okay, let's look at that. Run it, please.
See?
Is it amazing? That's how you learn to be a robot. You
did it all inside Omniverse. And the robot simulators called Isaac. Isaac Sim
and Isaac Lab. And anybody who wants to build a robot, you know, nobody could nobody's going to be as cute as you. But
now we have all Look at all these look at all these friends that we have building robots. We have We're building
big ones. No, like I said, nobody's as cute as you guys are. But we have Neurobot and we have we have Agubot.
Agubot over there, you know. We have uh uh LG over here. They just announced a
new robot. Caterpillar. They've got the largest robots ever. That one delivers
food to your house. That's connected to Uber Eats. And that's Surf Robot. I love those guys. Agility. Boston Dynamics.
Incredible. You got surgical robots. You got manipulator robots from Franka.
You got universal robotics robot. Incredible number of different robots. And so this is the next chapter. We're
going to talk a lot more about robotics in the future. But it's not just about the robots in the end. I know
everything's about you guys. It's about getting there. And one of the air one of the most important industries in the
world that will be revolutionized by physical AI and AI physics
is the industry that started all of us. at NVIDIA. It wouldn't be possible if
not for the companies that I'm about to talk to. And I'm so happy that all of them starting with Cadence is going to
accelerate everything. Cadence CUDA X integrated into all of their simulations and solvers. They've got uh NVIDIA
physical physical AIs that they're going to use for uh for different um physical plants and plant simulations. You got AI
physics being integrated into these systems. So whether it's an EDA or SDA
um and in the future robotic systems, we're going to have basically the same technology that made you guys possible
now completely revolutionize these design stacks. Synopsis without Synopsis, you know, synopsis and cadence
are completely completely indispensable in the world of chip design. uh synopsis
is uh leads in uh in uh logic design and and IP uh in the case of cadence they
lead physical design the place and route uh and emulation and verification.
Cadence is incredible at emulation and verification. Both of them are moving into the world of system design and
system simulation. And so in the future we're going to design your chips inside
Cadence and inside Synopsis. We're going to design your systems and emulate the whole thing and simulate everything
inside these tools. That's your future. We're going to give Yeah. You're going to be born inside these inside these
platforms. Pretty amazing, right? And so we're so happy that we're working with these these industries just as we've
integrated NVIDIA into Palunteer and Service Now. We're integrating Nvidia
into the most computationally intensive simulation industries, Synopsis and
Cadence. And today we're announcing that Seammens is also doing the same thing. We're going to integrate CUDA X physical
AI agentic AI Nemo Neotron deeply integrated into the world of Seammens.
And the reason for that is this. First, we designed the chips
and all of it in the future will be accelerated by Nvidia. You're going to be very happy about that. We're going to have Agentic chip designers and system
designers working with us, helping us do design just as we have agentic software
engineers helping our software engineers code today. And so we'll have agentic chip designers and system designers.
We're going to create you inside this. But then we have to build you. We have
to build the plants, the factories that make manufacture you. We have to design
the manufacturing lines that assemble all of you. And these manufacturing plants are going to be essentially
gigantic robots. Incredible, isn't that right? I know. I know. And so, you're going to
be designed in a computer. You're going to be made in a computer. You're going to be tested and evaluated in a computer
long before long before you have to spend any time dealing with gravity.
I know. Do you know how to deal with gravity? Can you jump?
Can you jump?
Okay. All right. Don't show off. Okay. So, so this so now
the industry the industry that made Nvidia possible. We're I'm just so happy
that that now the technology that we're creating is at a level of sophistication and capability that we can now help them
revolutionize their industry. And so what started with with uh with them, we
now have the opportunity to go back and and help them revolutionize theirs. Let's take a look at the stuff that we're going to do with Seammens.
Come on. Breakthroughs in physical AI are letting AI move from screens to our physical
world. And just in time, as the world builds factories of every kind for chips,
computers, life-saving drugs, and AI, as the global labor shortage worsens, we
need automation powered by physical AI and robotics more than ever.
This where AI meets the world's largest physical industries is the foundation of NVIDIA and Seaman's partnership. For
nearly two centuries, Seammens has built the world's industries and now it is reinventing it for the age
of AI. Semens is integrating NVIDIA CUDA X
libraries, AI models, and Omniverse into its portfolio of EDA,
CAE, and digital twin tools and platforms.
Together, we're bringing physical AI to the full industrial life cycle.
From design and simulation to production
and operations, we stand at the beginning of a new industrial revolution, the age of
physical AI built by Nvidia and Seammens for the next age of industries.
Incredible, right guys? What do you think? All right. Well, hang
on tight. Just hang on tight. And so, so this is, you know, if you look at look
at the world's models, there's no question OpenAI is the the the leading
token generator today. More to more open AAI tokens are generated than just about anything else. The second largest group,
the second largest probably open models. And my guess is that over time because there are so many companies, so many
researchers, so many different types of domains and modalities that open-source models will be by far the largest. Let's
talk about somebody really special. You guys want to do that? Let's talk about Vera Rubin.
Vera Rubin. Yeah, go ahead. She's a American astronomer.
She was the first to observe. She noticed that the tails of the galaxies
were moving about as fast as the center of the galaxies. Well, I know it makes
no sense. It makes no sense. Newtonian physics would say just like the solar system, the planets further away from
the sun is circulating circ cir circling the sun slower than the planets closer
to the sun. And therefore it makes no sense that this happens unless there's
invisible bodies we call them she discovered dark body dark matter um that
occupy space even though we don't see it and so Vera Rubin is the person that we
named our next computer after. Isn't that a good idea?
I know. Okay. Okay, Vera Rubin is designed to
address this fundamental challenge that we have. The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing. The
demand for NVIDIA GPUs is skyrocketing. It's skyrocketing because models are increasing by a factor of 10, an order
of a magnitude every single year. And not to mention, as I mentioned, 01's
introduction was an inflection point for AI. Instead of a oneshot answer,
inference is now a thinking process. And in order to teach the AI how to think,
reinforcement learning and very significant computation was introduced
into post training. It wasn't no long it's no longer supervised fine-tuning or
otherwise known as imitation learning or supervision training. You now have reinforcement learning
essentially the computer trial trying different iterations itself learning how to perform a task. The amount of
computation for pre pre-training for post- trainining for test time scaling has exploded as a result of that. And
now every single inference that we do instead of just one shot the number of tokens you could just see the AI think
which we appreciate. The longer it thinks oftentimes it produces a better answer. And so test time scaling causes
the number of tokens to be generated to increase by 5x every single year. Not to
mention, meanwhile, the race is on for AI. Everybody's trying to get to the
next level. Everybody's trying to get to the next frontier. And every time they get to the next frontier, the last
generation AI tokens, the cost starts to starts to decline about a factor of 10x
every year. The 10x decline every year is actually telling you something different. It's saying that the race is
so intense. Everybody's trying to get to the next level and somebody is getting to the next level. And so therefore, all
of it is a computing problem. The faster you compute, the sooner you can get to the next level of the next frontier. All
of these things are simultaneously happening at the same time. And so we decided that we have to advance
the state-of-the-art of computation every single year. Not one year left
behind. And now we've been shipping GB200s
year and a half ago. Right now we're in fullcale manufacturing of GB300.
And if Vera Rubin is going to be in time for this year, it must be in production
by now. And so today I can tell you that Vera Rubin is in full production.
You guys want to take a look at Vera Rubin? All right, come on. Play it, please.
Vera Rubin arrives just in time for the next frontier of AI.
This is the story of how we built it. The architecture, a system of six chips
engineered to work as one, born from extreme code design. It begins with Vera, a custom-designed CPU, double the
performance of the previous generation. And the Reuben GPU, Vera and Reuben are
co-designed from the start to birectionally and coherently share data faster and with lower latency.
Then 17,000 components come together on a Ver Rubin compute board.
High-speed robots place components with micron precision before the Vera CPU and
two Reuben GPUs complete the assembly. Capable of delivering 100 pedaflops of
AI, five times that of its predecessor.
AI needs data fast. Connect X9 delivers 1.6 6 terabs per
second of scale out bandwidth to each GPU.
Bluefield 4 DPU offloads storage and security so compute stays fully focused
on AI. The Vera Rubin compute tray completely redesigned with no cables, hoses, or
fans. Featuring a Bluefield 4 DPU, eight Connect X9 Nix, two Vera CPUs, and four
Reuben GPUs, the compute building block of the Vera Rubin AI supercomputer.
Next, the sixth generation MVLink switch, moving more data than the global
internet, connecting 18 compute nodes, scaling up to 72 Reuben GPUs, operating
as one. Then Spectrum X Ethernet Photonix,
the world's first Ethernet switch with 512 lanes and 200 Gbit capable
co-packaged optics scale out thousands of racks into an AI factory.
15,000 engineer years since design began, the first Vera Rubin MVL 72 rack
comes online. Six breakthrough chips, 18 compute trays, nine MVLink switch trays,
220 trillion transistors weighing nearly two tons.
One giant leap to the next frontier of AI. Reuben is here.
What do you guys think?
This is a Reuben pod. 1152 GPUs
in 16 racks. Each one of the racks as you know has uh 72
Vera Rubin or 72 Reubins. Each one of the Reubins is two actual GPU dies
connected together. I'm going to show I'm going to show it to you, but there are several things that Well, I'll tell
you later. I can't tell you everything right away.
Well, we designed six different chips. First of all, we have a rule inside our company, and it's a good rule. No new
generation should have more than one or two chips change. But the problem is
this. As you could see, we were describing the total number of transistors in each one of the chips
that were being described. And we know that Moore's law has largely slowed. And so the number of transistors we can get
year after year after year can't possibly keep up with the 10 times
larger models. It can't possibly keep up with five times per year more tokens
generated. It can't possibly keep up with the fact that cost decline of the
tokens are going to be so aggressive. It is impossible to keep up with those kind of rates if the indust for the industry
to continue to advance unless we deployed aggressive extreme code design
basically innovating across all of the chips across the entire stack all at the
same time. which is the reason why we decided that this generation we had no choice but to design every chip over
again. Now every single chip that we were describing just now can be a press conference in all in itself and there's
an entire company who's probably dedicated to doing that back in the old days. Each one of them are completely
revolutionary and the best of its kind. The Vera CPU I'm so proud of it in a
power constrained world. Gray CPU is two times the performance in a power
constrained world. It's twice the performance per watt of the world's most advanced CPUs. Its data rate is insane.
It was designed to process supercomputers and Vera was an
incredible GPU. Grace was an incredible GPU. Now Vera increases the
singlethreaded performance, increases the capacity of the memory, increases everything just dramatically. It's a
giant chip. This is the Vera CPU. This is one CPU.
And this is connected to the Reuben GPU. Look at that thing.
It's a giant chip. Now, the thing that's really special, and I I'll go through these. It's going to take three hands, I
think, four hands to do this. Okay. So, this is the Ver Vera CPU. It's got 88
CPU cores. And the CPU cores are designed to be multi-threaded. But the multi-threaded nature of of uh Vera was
designed so that each one of the 176 threads could get its full full
performance. So it's essentially as of there's 176 cores but only 88 physical cores. So these cores were designed in
in using a technology called spatial multi-threading. But the IO performance is incredible. This is the Reuben GPU.
It's 5x blackwell in floating performance. But the important thing is go to the bottom line. The bottom line
it's only 1.6 times the number of transistors of black wall. That kind of tells you something about the the levels
of semiconductor physics today. If we don't do code design, if we do don't do
extreme code design at the level of basically every single chip across the entire system, how is it
possible we deliver performance levels that is, you know, at best one point 1
1.6 times each year? Because that's the total number of transistors you have. And even if you were to have a little
bit more um performance per transistor, say 25%, you're this impossible to get a
100% yield out of the number of transistors you get. And so 1.6x kind of puts a ceiling on how far performance
can go each year unless you do something extreme. And we call it extreme code design. Well, one of the things that one
of the things that we did and it was a great invention. It's called MVF FP4 tensor core. The transformer engine
inside our chip is not just a 4bit floatingoint number somehow that we put into the data path. It is an entire
processor, a processing unit that understands how to dynamically
adaptively adjust its precision and structure to deal with different levels
of the transformer so that you can achieve higher throughput wherever it's possible to lose precision and to go
back to the highest possible precision wherever you need to. That ability to dynamically do that. You can't do this
in software because obviously it's just running too fast. And so you have to be able to do it adaptively inside the
processor. That's what an MVF FP4 is. When somebody says FP4 or FP8, it almost
means nothing to us. And the reason for that is because it's the tensor core structure in all of the algorithms that
makes makes it work. MV FP4, we've published papers on this already. The precision that the the level of
throughput and precision it's able to retain is in and completely incredible. This is groundbreaking work. I would not
be surprised that the industry would like us to make this format and this structure an industry standard in the
future. This is completely revolutionary. This is how we were able to deliver such a gigantic step up in
performance even though we only have 1.6 times the number of transistors. Okay.
So this is and now once you have a great processing node and this is the processor node and inside so this is
this is for example here let me do this
is this is wow it's super heavy you have to be a CEO in really good shape to do
this job okay all right so this thing is I'm
gonna guess this is probably I don't know couple of hundred pounds.
I thought that was funny too. Come on. It could have been. Everybody's
gone. No, I don't think so. All right. So So look at this. This is
the last one. We revolutionized the entire MGX chassis. This node
43 cables, zero cables, six tubes,
z just two of them here. It takes two hours to assemble this.
If you're lucky, it takes two hours. And of course, you're probably going to assemble it wrong. You're gonna have to
retest it, test it, reassemble it. So, the assembly process is incredibly complicated. And it was understandable
as one of our first supercomputers that's deconstructed in this way. This from two hours to 5 minutes.
80% liquid cooled. 100% liquid cooled.
Yeah. Really, really a breakthrough. Okay. So, so this is the new compute
chassis and what connects all of these to the top of rack switches, the east
west traffic is called the Spectrumx nick. This is the world's best nick.
Unquestionably, Nvidia's Melanox, the acquisition Melanox that joined us a long time ago now. Um, this their
networking technology for high performance computing is the world's best bar none. the algorithms, the chip
design, all of the interconnects, all the software stacks that run on top of it, their RDMA, absolutely absolutely
bar none, the world's best. And now it has the ability to do programmable RMDMA and data path accelerator so that our
partners like AI labs could create their own algorithms for how they want to move data around the system. But this is
completely world worldclass connect X9 and the Vera CPU were co-designed and
we never revealed it. not never never released it until CX9 came along because
we we co-designed it for a new type of processor. You know, Connect X9 or CX8 and Spectrum
X revolutionized how Ethernet was done for artificial intelligence. Ethernet
traffic for AI is much much more intense, requires much lower latency.
The the instantaneous surge of traffic is unlike anything Ethernet sees. And so
we created Spectrum X which is AI Ethernet. Two years ago we announced Spectrum X.
NVIDIA today is the largest networking company the world has ever seen. So it's
been so successful and used in so many different installations. It is just sweeping uh the AI landscape. The
performance is incredible especially when you have a 200 um megawatt data
center or if you have a gigawatt data center. These are billions of dollars. Let's say a gigawatt data center is $50
billion. If the networking performance allows you to deliver an extra 10%
in the case of Spectrum X, delivering 25% higher throughput is not uncommon.
If we were to just deliver 10% that's worth $5 billion. The networking is
completely free, which is the reason why, well, everybody uses Spectrum X. It's just an
incredible thing. And now we're going to invent a new type a new type of uh uh
data processing. And so spectral is for east west traffic. We now have a new
processor called blue field 4. Blue field 4 allows us to take a large large very large data center isolate different
parts of it so that different users could use different parts of it. Make sure that everything could be virtualized if they decide to be
virtualized. So you offload a lot of the um virtualization software, the security
software, the networking software for your north south traffic. And so Bluefield 4 comes standard with every
single one of these compute nodes. Bluefield 4 has a second application I'm going to talk about in just a second.
This is a revolutionary processor and I'm so excited about it. This is the MVLink 6 switch
and it's right here. This is the this switch. This switch
chip there are four of them inside the MVLink switch here. Each one of these switchips has the
fastest certis in history. The world is barely getting to 200 Gbits. This is 400
Gbits per second switch. The reason why this is so important is so that we could
have every single GPU talk to every other GPU at exactly the same time. This
switch, this switch on the back plane of one of these racks enables us to move
the equivalent of twice the amount of the global internet data,
twice as all of the world's internet data at twice the speed. You take the
cross-sectional bandwidth of the entire planet's internet, it's about 100 terabytes per second. This is 240
terabytes per second. So it kind of puts it in perspective. This is so that every single GPU can work with every single
other GPU at exactly the same time. Okay. Then on top of that
on top of that okay so this is one rack. This is one rack. Each one of the racks as you could see the number of
transistors in this one rack is 1.7 times.
Yeah. Could you do this for me? So, this is it's usually about two tons, but
today it's two and a half tons because um when they shipped it, they forgot to drain the water out of it.
So, we we shipped a lot of water from California.
Can you hear it squealing? You know, when you're rotating two and a half tons,
you got to squeal a little. Oh, you could do it. Wow.
Okay, we just we won't make you do that twice. All right. So, so um so behind
behind this are the MVLink spines. Basically, two miles of copper cables.
Copper is the best conductor we know. And these are all shielded copper cables, structured copper cables, the
most the world's ever used in computing systems ever. and and um uh our certis
drive the copper cables from the top of the rack all the way to the bottom of the rack at 400 gigabits per second.
It's incredible. And so uh this has 2 miles of total copper cables, 5,000 copper cables. And this makes the MVLink
uh spine possible. This is the revolution that that really started the NGX system. Now we we decided that we
would create an industry standard system so that the entire ecosystem all of our supply chain could standardize on these
components. There some 80,000 different components that make up this
these MGX systems and it's a total waste if we were to change it every single year. every single major computer
company from Foxcon to Quanta to Wistron, you know, the list goes on and on and on to HP and Dell and Lenovo,
everybody knows how to build these systems. And so the fact that we could squeeze Ruben Vera Rubin into this even
though the performance is so much so much higher and very importantly the power is twice as high. The power of
Vera Rubin is twice as high as Grace Blackwell. And yet, and this is the
miracle, the air that goes into it, the the air flow is about the same. And very
importantly, the water that goes into it is the same temperature, 45° C. With 45°
C, no water chillers are necessary for data centers. We're basically cooling
this supercomput with hot water. is so incredibly efficient. And so
this is um this is the new the new rack. 1.7 times more transistors, but five
times more peak inference performance, three and a half times more peak u uh uh
training performance. Okay, they're connected on top using Spectrum
X. Oh, thank you.
This is this is the world's first manufacturing chip using uh TSMC's
new process that we co-inovated called coupe. It's a silicon photonix integrated silicon photonix process
technology. And this allows us to take silicon photonix directly right to the
chip. And this is 512 ports at 200 Gbits per second. And this is the new Ethernet
AI switch, the Spectrum X Ethernet switch. And look at this giant chip. But what's really amazing, it's got silicon
photonics directly connected to it. And lasers come in.
Lasers come in through here. Lasers come in through here. The optics are here and
they connect out to the rest of the data data center. This I'll show you in a second, but this is on top of the rack.
And this is the new Spectrum X um silicon photonic switch. Okay.
And we have something new I want to tell you about. So just as I mentioned a couple years ago,
we introduced Spectrum X so that we could reinvent the way that networking is done. Um Ethernet is really easy to
manage and everybody has an Ethernet stack and every data center in the world knows how to deal with Ethernet. Um and
the only thing that we were we were using at the time was called Infiniband which is used for supercomputers.
Infiniband is very low latency. Um but of course the software stack the entire
manageability of Infiniband is very alien to the people who use Ethernet. So we decided to enter the Ethernet switch
market for the very first time. Spectrum X that just took off and it made us the
largest networking company in the world. As I mentioned, this next generation spectrum is going to carry on that
tradition. But just as I said earlier, AI has reinvented the whole computing
stack, every layer of the computing stack. It stands to reason that when AI
starts to get deployed in the world's enterprises, it's going to also reinvent the way storage is done. Well, AI
doesn't use SQL. AI use semantics information. And when AI is being used,
it creates this temporary knowledge, temporary temporary memory calls KV cache, K key value combinations, but
it's a KV cache. Basically, the cache of the AI, the working memory of the AI. And the working memory of the AI is
stored in the HBO memory. Every single token, for every single token,
the H the GPU reads in the model, the entire model. It reads in the entire
working memory and it produces one token and it stores that one token back into
the KV cache and then the next to the next time it does that it reads in the entire memory reads it and it streams it
through our GPU and then generates another token. Well, it does this repeatedly token after token after token
and obviously if you have a long conversation with that AI over time that memory that context memory is going to
grow tremendously. Not to mention the models are growing. The number of turns that we're using, the AI are are
increasing. We would like to have this AI stay with us our entire life. And remember, every single conversation
we've ever had with it, right? Every single lick of research that I've asked it for. Of course, we the number of
people that will be sharing the supercomputer is going to continue to grow. And so this context memory, which
started out fitting inside an HBM, is no longer large enough. Last year we
created Grace Blackwell's very fast memory we called fast context
memory in that's the reason why we connected grace directly to hopper
that's why we connected grace directly to blackwell so that we can expand the context memory but even that is not
enough and so the next solution of course is to go off onto the network the north south network off to the storage
of the company but if you have a whole lot of AIs running at the same time that
network is no longer going to be fast enough. So the answer is very clearly to do it different. And so we intro we
created Bluefield 4 so that we could essentially have a very fast KV cache
context memory store right in the rack. And so I'll show you in just one second,
but there's a whole new category of storage systems. And the industry is so
excited because this is a pain point for just about everybody who does a lot of token generation today. the AI labs, the
cloud service providers, they're really suffering from the amount of network traffic that's causing being caused by
KV cache moving around. And so the idea that we would create a new platform, a new processor to run the entire Dynamo
KV cache context memory management system and to put it very close to the
rest of the rack is completely revolutionary. So this is it. This is it sits right here.
So this this is all the compute nodes. Each one of these is MVLink 72. So this
is Vera Rubin MVLink 72 144 U R Reuben GPUs. This is the context
memory that's stored here. Behind each one of these are four blue fields. Behind each blue field is 150 gigab 150
terabytes 150 terabytes of memory context memory. And for each GPU once you allocate it
across each GPU will get an additional 16 terabytes. Now inside this node each
GPU essentially has one terabyte. And now with this backing store here
directly on the same east west traffic at exactly the same data rate 200 gigabits per second across literally the
entire fabric of this compute node. you're going to get an additional 16 terabytes of memory. Okay. And this is
the management plane. These are these are the spectrum X
switches that connects all of them together. And over here, these switches at the end
connects them to the rest of the data center. Okay. And so this is the Vera
Rubin. Now there are several things that's really incredible about it. So the first thing that I mentioned is that
the this entire system is twice the
energy efficiency essentially the that twice the the the temperature performance in the sense that that even
though the power is twice as high the amount of energy used is twice as high the amount of computation is many times
higher than that but the liquid that goes into it still 45 degrees C that
enables us to save about 6% % of the world's data center power. So that's a very big deal. The second very big deal
is that this entire system is now confidential computing safe. Meaning everything is encoded in transit at rest
and during compute and every single bus is now encrypted. every PCI Express,
every MV link, every H you know for a MVL link between CPU me and GPU between
GPU to GPU, everything is now encrypted and so it's confidential computing safe.
This allows companies to feel safe that their models are being deployed by
somebody else but it will never be seen by anybody else. Okay. And so this particular system is not only incredibly
energy efficient and there's one other thing that's incredible because of the nature of the workload of
AI it spikes instantaneously with this computation layer called all
reduce the amount of current the amount of energy that is used but
simultaneously is really off the charts. Oftentimes it'll spike up 25%. We now
have power smoothing across the entire system so that you don't have to overprovision by 25 times or if you
overprovision by 25 times you don't have to leave 25 times 25% 25% not 25 times
25% of the energy um squandered or unused and so now you could fill up the
entire power budget and you don't have to over you don't have to proceed you don't have to provision beyond that and
then the Last thing of course is performance. So let's take a look at the performance of this. These are only
charts that people who build AI super supercomputers would love. It took exact
it took every single one of these chips complete redesign of every single one of the systems and rewriting the entire
stack for us to make this possible. Basically this is training the AI model. This
first column, the faster you train AI models, the faster you can get the next
frontier out to the world. This is your time to market. This is technology leadership. This is your pricing power.
And so in the case of the green, this is essentially
a 10 trillion parameter model. We scaled it up from deepse deepse. That's why we
call it deepsee++ a training a 10 trillion parameter model on a 100
trillion tokens. Okay. And that's this is our simulation projection of what it
would take for us to build the next frontier model. The next frontier model uh Elon's already mentioned that the
next version of Grock Grock 5 I think is 7 trillion parameters. This is 10 and in
the green is black. Well, and here in the case of um uh Reuben, notice the
throughput is so much higher and therefore it only takes 1/4th as many of these systems in order to train the
model in the time that we gave it here which is one month. Okay. And so time
time is the same for everybody. Now how much how fast you can train that model and how large of a model you can train
is how you're going to get to the frontier first. The second part is your factory throughput.
Blackwell is green again. And factory throughput is important because your factory is in the case of a gigawatt is
$50 billion. A $50 billion data center
can only consume one gigawatt of power. And so if your performance, your
throughput per watt is very good versus quite poor, that directly translates to
your revenues. Your revenues of your data center is directly related to the
second second column. And in the case of Blackwell, it was about 10 times over
Hopper. In the case of Reuben, it's going to be about 10 times higher again. Okay. And in the case of now the um the
cost of the tokens, how cost effectively it is to generate the token. This is
Reuben about one/10enth just as in the case of Yep.
So that's how this is how we're going to get everybody to the next frontier to um push AI to the next level and of
course to build these data centers energy efficiently and cost efficiently.
So this is it. This is Nvidia today. You know, we mentioned that we build chips,
but as you know, Nvidia builds entire systems now. And AI is a full stack. We
we're reinventing AI across everything from chips to infrastructure to models
to applications. And our job is to create the entire stack so that all of you could create incredible applications
uh for the rest of the world. Thank you all for coming. Have a great CES. Now,
before before I before I let you guys go, uh there were a whole bunch of slides we had to cut we had to leave on
the cutting floor and so we have some out takes here. I think it'll be fun for you. Have a great CES, guys.
And cut. Nvidia live at CES. Take four. Marker.
Boom. Mike action.
Sorry guys. Platform shift, huh?
That should do it. And let's roll camera.
A shade of green. A bright happy green. World's most powerful AI supercomput you
can plug into the wall next to my toaster.
Hey guys, I'm I'm stuck again. I'm so sorry. This slide is never going to work. Let's just cut it. Hello. Can you hear me?
So, like I was saying, the router. Because not every problem needs the biggest, smartest model. Just the right
one. No, no, don't lose any of them. This new six chip Reuben platform makes
one amazing AI supercomputer. There you go, little guy.
Oh no, no, not the scaling laws. There is a squirrel on the car. Be ready
to make the squirrel go away. Ask the squirrel gently to move away. Did you know the best models today are
all mixture of experts? Hey
Where'd everybody go?
