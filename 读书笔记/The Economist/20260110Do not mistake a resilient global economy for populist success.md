# Do not mistake a resilient global economy for populist success

PESSIMISTS ABOUT the world economy have had a poor run. Global growth was probably about 3% in 2025, far higher than gloomy forecasts made in the spring and summer. That matches the pattern of the decade. Every year so far in the 2020s, the “Teflon economy” has beaten the World Bank forecast made in June. In 2025 America especially defied expectations. It slowed under Donald Trump, after accounting for the mechanical impact of lower immigration, but only a little. Now global interest rates have fallen and, in America, China and Germany, fiscal stimulus is supporting growth.

The resilience of the world economy may flummox market liberals, because it has coincided with protectionist policies. So far this decade industrial policy has proliferated, supply chains have fragmented and Mr Trump has levied the highest tariffs in America since the 1930s. Yet it is hard, at first glance, to spot the damage. Populists crow that, as usual, the experts were wrong.

They are only half-right. It is true that protectionism has not yet derailed growth. But industrial policies and tariffs have also failed in their central aim: arresting the decline of manufacturing jobs. That suggests the world economy is merely coping with populism, rather than flourishing under it.

As we report this week, American manufacturing is in a rut. The sector has contracted every month since March 2025, according to surveys, which also show firms complaining about the high cost of imported parts. Over the past year manufacturers’ construction spending has shrunk, as have their payrolls.



It is not just in America that the industry is suffering. Globally, manufacturing has lagged behind growth for the past three years, calculates JPMorgan Chase, a bank. From 2019 to 2025 manufacturing jobs fell as a share of the workforce on every continent except Africa, reckons the International Labour Organisation. Bidenomics, Trumponomics, “Make in India” and the like have barely dented the long-run trend.

Do not bet on that changing. For all the uncertainty hanging over white-collar jobs because of AI, it is factory hands who continue to be the world’s most disrupted workers. The pace of the decline in manufacturing jobs, as a share of the global workforce, has been slightly faster in the 2020s than in the preceding three decades. Recently job openings have dried up quicker at America’s factories than in its offices. And although manufacturing work is not threatened directly by chatbots, AI models trained with data from sensors and cameras are making factory robots better. On January 5th Nvidia’s boss, Jensen Huang, declared that “the ChatGPT moment for robotics is here.” That might help output, but will probably make the jobs that politicians strive to create still scarcer.

There is one place where manufacturing is thriving and factory jobs are fairly steady: China, whose share of global manufacturing value-added, at nearly one-third, is almost twice America’s. China’s industrial might threatens the national security of the West by giving it chokeholds over important industries, but it is hardly proving to be an economic boon. Its leaders’ willingness to back manufacturers with state money has distorted the economy. The resulting overcapacity in Chinese factories has contributed to its deflation problem.

Ironically, it is the adaptive power of markets that accounts for the world economy’s resilience to trade barriers. For years supply chains have snaked around whatever obstacles have been thrown up. And it is America’s private sector, not industrial planners in Washington, which is chiefly responsible for the AI boom. The ongoing success of free markets is obscuring the damage protectionism is doing. Do not mistake global economic resilience for a triumph by the likes of Mr Trump. ■

# Do not mistake a resilient global economy for populist success

## Original English Text + Chinese Translation

### Title (标题)
**English:** Do not mistake a resilient global economy for populist success  
**Chinese:** 不要将全球经济的韧性误认为是民粹主义的成功

### Paragraph 1
**English:** PESSIMISTS ABOUT the world economy have had a poor run. Global growth was probably about 3% in 2025, far higher than gloomy forecasts made in the spring and summer. That matches the pattern of the decade. Every year so far in the 2020s, the “Teflon economy” has beaten the World Bank forecast made in June. In 2025 America especially defied expectations. It slowed under Donald Trump, after accounting for the mechanical impact of lower immigration, but only a little. Now global interest rates have fallen and, in America, China and Germany, fiscal stimulus is supporting growth.  
**Chinese:** 对世界经济持悲观态度的人最近运气不佳。2025年的全球增长率可能约为3%，远高于春夏季节的悲观预测。这符合本十年的模式。到目前为止，2020年代的每一年，“铁氟龙经济”都超过了世界银行6月份的预测。2025年，美国尤其违背了预期。在唐纳德·特朗普领导下，考虑到移民减少的机械影响，它有所放缓，但幅度很小。现在全球利率已经下降，在美国、中国和德国，财政刺激正在支持增长。

### Paragraph 2
**English:** The resilience of the world economy may flummox market liberals, because it has coincided with protectionist policies. So far this decade industrial policy has proliferated, supply chains have fragmented and Mr Trump has levied the highest tariffs in America since the 1930s. Yet it is hard, at first glance, to spot the damage. Populists crow that, as usual, the experts were wrong.  
**Chinese:** 世界经济的韧性可能会让市场自由主义者感到困惑，因为它与保护主义政策同时发生。本十年到目前为止，产业政策已经扩散，供应链已经碎片化，特朗普先生征收了自1930年代以来美国最高的关税。然而，一眼看去，很难发现损害。民粹主义者得意地宣称，像往常一样，专家们错了。

### Paragraph 3
**English:** They are only half-right. It is true that protectionism has not yet derailed growth. But industrial policies and tariffs have also failed in their central aim: arresting the decline of manufacturing jobs. That suggests the world economy is merely coping with populism, rather than flourishing under it.  
**Chinese:** 他们只说对了一半。保护主义尚未使增长脱轨，这是事实。但产业政策和关税也未能实现其核心目标：阻止制造业就业的下降。这表明世界经济只是勉强应对民粹主义，而不是在其下繁荣。

### Paragraph 4
**English:** As we report this week, American manufacturing is in a rut. The sector has contracted every month since March 2025, according to surveys, which also show firms complaining about the high cost of imported parts. Over the past year manufacturers’ construction spending has shrunk, as have their payrolls.  
**Chinese:** 正如我们本周报道的，美国制造业陷入困境。根据调查，该部门自2025年3月以来每个月都在收缩，调查还显示企业抱怨进口零部件的高成本。过去一年，制造商的建筑支出已经缩减，他们的工资支出也是如此。

### Paragraph 5
**English:** It is not just in America that the industry is suffering. Globally, manufacturing has lagged behind growth for the past three years, calculates JPMorgan Chase, a bank. From 2019 to 2025 manufacturing jobs fell as a share of the workforce on every continent except Africa, reckons the International Labour Organisation. Bidenomics, Trumponomics, “Make in India” and the like have barely dented the long-run trend.  
**Chinese:** 不仅仅在美国，这个行业正在遭受苦难。全球制造业在过去三年落后于增长，摩根大通银行计算得出。从2019年到2025年，除非洲外，每个大陆制造业就业在劳动力中的占比都下降了，国际劳工组织估计。拜登经济学、特朗普经济学、“印度制造”等几乎没有影响长期趋势。

### Paragraph 6
**English:** Do not bet on that changing. For all the uncertainty hanging over white-collar jobs because of AI, it is factory hands who continue to be the world’s most disrupted workers. The pace of the decline in manufacturing jobs, as a share of the global workforce, has been slightly faster in the 2020s than in the preceding three decades. Recently job openings have dried up quicker at America’s factories than in its offices. And although manufacturing work is not threatened directly by chatbots, AI models trained with data from sensors and cameras are making factory robots better. On January 5th Nvidia’s boss, Jensen Huang, declared that “the ChatGPT moment for robotics is here.” That might help output, but will probably make the jobs that politicians strive to create still scarcer.  
**Chinese:** 不要指望这种情况会改变。尽管人工智能给白领工作带来了不确定性，但工厂工人继续是世界上最受干扰的工人。制造业就业在全球劳动力中的占比下降速度，在2020年代比前三个十年略快。最近，美国工厂的职位空缺比办公室更快地枯竭。虽然制造业工作没有直接受到聊天机器人的威胁，但用传感器和摄像头数据训练的人工智能模型正在让工厂机器人变得更好。1月5日，英伟达的老板黄仁勋宣布“机器人领域的ChatGPT时刻已经到来。”这可能有助于产量，但很可能让政客们努力创造的就业机会变得更加稀缺。

### Paragraph 7
**English:** There is one place where manufacturing is thriving and factory jobs are fairly steady: China, whose share of global manufacturing value-added, at nearly one-third, is almost twice America’s. China’s industrial might threatens the national security of the West by giving it chokeholds over important industries, but it is hardly proving to be an economic boon. Its leaders’ willingness to back manufacturers with state money has distorted the economy. The resulting overcapacity in Chinese factories has contributed to its deflation problem.  
**Chinese:** 有一个地方制造业正在繁荣，工厂就业相对稳定：中国，其全球制造业增加值份额接近三分之一，几乎是美国的两倍。中国工业实力通过对重要行业的扼制威胁西方的国家安全，但它几乎没有证明是经济上的恩惠。其领导者愿意用国家资金支持制造商，这扭曲了经济。中国工厂由此产生的产能过剩加剧了其通缩问题。

### Paragraph 8
**English:** Ironically, it is the adaptive power of markets that accounts for the world economy’s resilience to trade barriers. For years supply chains have snaked around whatever obstacles have been thrown up. And it is America’s private sector, not industrial planners in Washington, which is chiefly responsible for the AI boom. The ongoing success of free markets is obscuring the damage protectionism is doing. Do not mistake global economic resilience for a triumph by the likes of Mr Trump. ■  
**Chinese:** 讽刺的是，正是市场的适应力解释了世界经济对贸易壁垒的韧性。多年来，供应链一直蜿蜒绕过任何障碍。而且是美国的私营部门，而不是华盛顿的产业规划者，主要负责人工智能繁荣。自由市场的持续成功正在掩盖保护主义造成的损害。不要将全球经济韧性误认为是特朗普先生之流的胜利。■
