# AI is transforming the pharma industry for the better

It is changing the way drugs are discovered and tested

Drug development is notoriously failure-prone. Only one in every ten drug candidates that enter human trials eventually goes onto the market. Turning a promising molecule into a useful medicine typically takes ten to 15 years after its discovery. These challenging economics mean that the cost of developing each successful drug is roughly $2.8bn. And because medicines ultimately come off-patent, the drive to find the next blockbuster is relentless.

Enter generative AI, which the pharma industry is adopting at a terrific rate. By ingesting and analysing vast biological data sets, AI tools can identify promising target proteins and then suggest novel molecules that could latch onto those drug targets. They can sift through libraries of data to predict the potency and toxicity of candidates, before a single test tube is touched AI can also help with trials, analysing health records to find the patients most likely to respond to novel treatments. Though it is still early days, the signs are promising. ai could lead to more efficient drug discovery, better medicines and more competition in the industry.

ai-designed molecules show an 80-90% success rate in early-stage safety trials, compared with a historical average of just 40-65%. It will be years before it becomes clear whether success rates rise in later-stage trials, too. But even if they do not, one model suggests that early-stage improvements alone could increase the success rate across the entire pipeline from 5-10% to 9-18%. The industry is also wringing efficiencies out of its business using AI, in areas from clinical documentation to HR. McKinsey reckons that if AI is fully utilised by the pharma industry—no doubt with its consultants’ assistance—it could provide a boost worth $60bn-110bn annually.

The hope is that improvements in the technology will push up the success rate even further. Sophisticated new models for understanding tricky bits of biology are emerging at a rapid pace. A few years ago an AI model called AlphaFold solved the problem of figuring out the structure of proteins. More complex puzzles, such as how cell membranes function, are likely to be cracked at some point.

The technology is already changing how the pharma industry works. A new generation of AI-native biotech startups—particularly in America and China—is emerging. Pharma companies are increasingly forming alliances with AI-biotech firms, as well as with technology giants including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Nvidia. And those big tech firms have their own ambitions in health. Isomorphic Labs, a spin-out from Google DeepMind, is trying to design entirely new therapeutic molecules from scratch inside a computer. Nvidia, too, has a generative-AI platform for drug discovery. Both firms are signing deals to offer design services to pharma companies. And in October Nvidia teamed up with Eli Lilly, the world’s most valuable drugmaker, to build the pharma industry’s most powerful supercomputer.

All this means that some of the value of drug discovery may be captured by tech giants. For now, pharma firms have many clear advantages, including heaps of data, scientists who know the field and long experience of shepherding new drugs through a maze of regulation. Over time, though, as parts of biology become more of a computational problem that can be solved with technology, such advantages could be eroded. Pharma firms may need to buy in ai expertise in the same way that they buy early-stage assets from biotech firms today.

As drug discovery becomes more efficient, governments will need to turn their attention to other potential bottlenecks in the system, such as regulation and trials. America’s Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency are themselves starting to use ai to screen the mountains of data they receive. As the number of drug candidates rises, faster regulatory reviews will be needed to avoid a logjam. Governments could also do more to encourage the sharing of patient data with AI companies in privacy-preserving ways so that AI models—and drug discovery—can improve.

Patents, too, will need rethinking. Today, long patent lives let pharma firms recoup the investments they make, encouraging them to undertake the risky business of drug discovery. Yet if the costs and riskiness of innovation fall dramatically, then patent terms (which typically provide 10-15 years of market exclusivity) may need to become shorter. ai brings good news for drug innovation. But to ensure that it benefits both the makers and takers of new drugs, the industry and its regulators will need to adjust to this new reality. ■

# AI is transforming the pharma industry for the better

## Original English Text + Chinese Translation

### Title (标题)
**English:** AI is transforming the pharma industry for the better  
**Chinese:** 人工智能正在改善制药行业

### Subtitle (副标题)
**English:** It is changing the way drugs are discovered and tested  
**Chinese:** 它正在改变药物发现和测试的方式

### Paragraph 1
**English:** Drug development is notoriously failure-prone. Only one in every ten drug candidates that enter human trials eventually goes onto the market. Turning a promising molecule into a useful medicine typically takes ten to 15 years after its discovery. These challenging economics mean that the cost of developing each successful drug is roughly $2.8bn. And because medicines ultimately come off-patent, the drive to find the next blockbuster is relentless.  
**Chinese:** 药物开发以失败率高而闻名。只有每十个进入人体试验的候选药物中有一个最终上市。将一个有前景的分子转化为有用的药物通常在其发现后需要10到15年。这些具有挑战性的经济因素意味着开发每一种成功药物的成本大约为28亿美元。而且因为药物最终会失去专利保护，寻找下一个重磅炸弹的驱动力是无情的。

### Paragraph 2
**English:** Enter generative AI, which the pharma industry is adopting at a terrific rate. By ingesting and analysing vast biological data sets, AI tools can identify promising target proteins and then suggest novel molecules that could latch onto those drug targets. They can sift through libraries of data to predict the potency and toxicity of candidates, before a single test tube is touched AI can also help with trials, analysing health records to find the patients most likely to respond to novel treatments. Though it is still early days, the signs are promising. ai could lead to more efficient drug discovery, better medicines and more competition in the industry.  
**Chinese:** 进入生成式人工智能，制药行业正在以惊人的速度采用它。通过摄取和分析庞大的生物数据集，人工智能工具可以识别有前景的目标蛋白，然后建议可能附着在这些药物靶点上的新型分子。它们可以筛选数据库来预测候选药物的效力和毒性，在触摸任何一个试管之前。人工智能还可以帮助试验，分析健康记录以找到最有可能对新型治疗做出反应的患者。虽然还处于早期阶段，但迹象是令人鼓舞的。人工智能可能导致更高效的药物发现、更好的药物以及行业中更多的竞争。

### Paragraph 3
**English:** ai-designed molecules show an 80-90% success rate in early-stage safety trials, compared with a historical average of just 40-65%. It will be years before it becomes clear whether success rates rise in later-stage trials, too. But even if they do not, one model suggests that early-stage improvements alone could increase the success rate across the entire pipeline from 5-10% to 9-18%. The industry is also wringing efficiencies out of its business using AI, in areas from clinical documentation to HR. McKinsey reckons that if AI is fully utilised by the pharma industry—no doubt with its consultants’ assistance—it could provide a boost worth $60bn-110bn annually.  
**Chinese:** 人工智能设计的分子在早期安全试验中显示出80-90%的成功率，而历史平均值仅为40-65%。还需要几年才能清楚后期试验的成功率是否也会上升。但即使不上升，一个模型表明，仅早期改进就可以将整个管道的成功率从5-10%提高到9-18%。该行业还在使用人工智能从其业务中挤出效率，从临床文档到人力资源领域。麦肯锡认为，如果制药行业充分利用人工智能——无疑在其顾问的协助下——它每年可以提供价值600亿至1100亿美元的提升。

### Paragraph 4
**English:** The hope is that improvements in the technology will push up the success rate even further. Sophisticated new models for understanding tricky bits of biology are emerging at a rapid pace. A few years ago an AI model called AlphaFold solved the problem of figuring out the structure of proteins. More complex puzzles, such as how cell membranes function, are likely to be cracked at some point.  
**Chinese:** 希望是技术的改进将进一步提高成功率。用于理解生物学棘手部分的复杂新模型正在以快速的速度出现。几年前，一个名为AlphaFold的人工智能模型解决了弄清蛋白质结构的问题。更复杂的谜题，例如细胞膜如何运作，很可能在某个时候被破解。

### Paragraph 5
**English:** The technology is already changing how the pharma industry works. A new generation of AI-native biotech startups—particularly in America and China—is emerging. Pharma companies are increasingly forming alliances with AI-biotech firms, as well as with technology giants including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Nvidia. And those big tech firms have their own ambitions in health. Isomorphic Labs, a spin-out from Google DeepMind, is trying to design entirely new therapeutic molecules from scratch inside a computer. Nvidia, too, has a generative-AI platform for drug discovery. Both firms are signing deals to offer design services to pharma companies. And in October Nvidia teamed up with Eli Lilly, the world’s most valuable drugmaker, to build the pharma industry’s most powerful supercomputer.  
**Chinese:** 该技术已经在改变制药行业的工作方式。新一代人工智能本土的生物技术初创企业——特别是在美国和中国——正在出现。制药公司越来越多地与人工智能生物技术公司以及包括亚马逊、谷歌、微软和英伟达在内的科技巨头形成联盟。而且这些大型科技公司在健康领域有自己的雄心。Isomorphic Labs，谷歌DeepMind的分拆公司，正在尝试在计算机内从零设计全新的治疗分子。英伟达也有一个用于药物发现的生成式人工智能平台。两家公司都在签署协议，向制药公司提供设计服务。而且在10月，英伟达与全球最有价值的制药公司礼来公司合作，构建制药行业最强大的超级计算机。

### Paragraph 6
**English:** All this means that some of the value of drug discovery may be captured by tech giants. For now, pharma firms have many clear advantages, including heaps of data, scientists who know the field and long experience of shepherding new drugs through a maze of regulation. Over time, though, as parts of biology become more of a computational problem that can be solved with technology, such advantages could be eroded. Pharma firms may need to buy in ai expertise in the same way that they buy early-stage assets from biotech firms today.  
**Chinese:** 所有这一切意味着药物发现的一些价值可能被科技巨头捕获。目前，制药公司有许多明显的优势，包括大量数据、了解该领域的科学家以及长期引导新药通过监管迷宫的经验。然而，随着时间的推移，随着生物学的部分变得更多的是可以用技术解决的计算问题，这样的优势可能会被侵蚀。制药公司可能需要以今天从生物技术公司购买早期资产的方式购买人工智能专长。

### Paragraph 7
**English:** As drug discovery becomes more efficient, governments will need to turn their attention to other potential bottlenecks in the system, such as regulation and trials. America’s Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency are themselves starting to use ai to screen the mountains of data they receive. As the number of drug candidates rises, faster regulatory reviews will be needed to avoid a logjam. Governments could also do more to encourage the sharing of patient data with AI companies in privacy-preserving ways so that AI models—and drug discovery—can improve.  
**Chinese:** 随着药物发现变得更高效，政府将需要将注意力转向系统中其他潜在的瓶颈，例如监管和试验。美国食品和药物管理局以及欧洲药品管理局本身开始使用人工智能筛选他们收到的大量数据。随着候选药物数量的增加，需要更快的监管审查以避免拥堵。政府还可以做更多来鼓励以保护隐私的方式与人工智能公司分享患者数据，以便人工智能模型——以及药物发现——可以改进。

### Paragraph 8
**English:** Patents, too, will need rethinking. Today, long patent lives let pharma firms recoup the investments they make, encouraging them to undertake the risky business of drug discovery. Yet if the costs and riskiness of innovation fall dramatically, then patent terms (which typically provide 10-15 years of market exclusivity) may need to become shorter. ai brings good news for drug innovation. But to ensure that it benefits both the makers and takers of new drugs, the industry and its regulators will need to adjust to this new reality. ■  
**Chinese:** 专利也需要重新思考。今天，长的专利寿命让制药公司收回他们所做的投资，鼓励他们从事药物发现的风险业务。然而，如果创新的成本和风险性急剧下降，那么专利期限（通常提供10-15年的市场独占权）可能需要变得更短。人工智能为药物创新带来了好消息。但为了确保它惠及新药的制造者和使用者，该行业及其监管者将需要适应这个新现实。■
