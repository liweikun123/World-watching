How AI is rewiring childhood

The technology presents dazzling opportunities—and ominous risks

CHRISTMAS STOCKINGS may contain more surprises than usual this year, as children open presents that can talk back. Toymakers in China have declared 2025 the year of artificial intelligence (AI) and are producing robots and teddies that can teach, play and tell stories. Older children, meanwhile, are glued to viral AI videos and AI-enhanced games. At school, many are being taught with materials created with tools like ChatGPT. Some are even learning alongside chatbot-tutors.

In work and play, AI is rewiring childhood. It promises every child the kind of upbringing previously available only to the rich, with private tutors, personalised syllabuses and bespoke entertainment. Children can listen to songs composed about them, read stories in which they star, play video games that adapt to their skill level and have an entourage of chatbot friends cheering them on. A childhood fit for a king could become universal.

It is a future filled with opportunities—and hidden traps. As real kings often discover, a bespoke upbringing can also be a lonely and atomised one. What’s more, as their subjects often find out, it can create adults who are ill-equipped for real life. As AI changes childhood for better and for worse, society must rethink the business of growing up.

Being reared by robots has advantages. Tech firms are already showing how AI can enhance learning, especially where teachers and materials are scarce. Literacy and language-learning have been boosted in early trials. The dream is that, with an AI tutor, children can be saved from classes pitched to the median, in which bright pupils are bored and dim ones are lost. If you want a version of this leader for an eight-year-old Hindi-speaker, AI can rewrite it; if they would prefer it as a cartoon strip or a song, no problem.

Technology is creating new forms of fun, too. Hollywood may dismiss AI videos as “slop”, but young people are devouring them and making their own. Old toys are being upgraded: an AI-powered edition of “Trivial Pursuit” can pose questions on any topic. Video games are creating novel experiences, such as chatting to Darth Vader in “Fortnite”. Any child can meet their heroes (and shoot them).

There are well-publicised risks in letting children loose on an evolving technology. AI tutors may hallucinate wrong answers. Toys can go off the rails: parents should check stockings for the AI teddy that was recently found to have spiced up its chat with talk of kinky sex. Children can easily misuse AI, to cheat at homework or harass each other with “deepfake” videos. Chatbots can coax vulnerable adolescents into harming themselves. Tech firms insist these stumbling blocks can be fixed; ChatGPT is only three years old.

Yet childhood may be disrupted most radically by things that AI does when it is behaving as intended. The technology quickly learns what its master likes—and shows more of it. Social-media feeds have already created echo chambers where people see only views they agree with (or love to hate). AI threatens to strengthen these echo chambers and lock children into them at an early age. The child who likes football may be told football stories by his teddy and given footballing examples by his AI tutor. Not only does this stamp out serendipity. A favourites-only diet means a child need never learn to tolerate something unfamiliar.

One-sided relationships with chatbots present a similar risk. AI companions that never criticise, nor share feelings of their own, are a poor preparation for dealing with imperfect humans. A third of American teenagers say they find chatting to an AI companion at least as satisfying as talking to a friend, and easier than talking to their parents. Yes-bots threaten to create children not used to taking turns, who grow up into colleagues unable to compromise and partners unfamiliar with the give-and-take required in a relationship.

Other trends are pushing in the same direction. As birth rates crash, fewer children are growing up with siblings to smooth their sharp edges. Rising numbers of young adults are deciding that long-term romantic relationships are not worth the hassle. Remote work means that people who grow up in a personalised, asocial world can slip into jobs where they interact with colleagues only through screens—a chore they may soon delegate to an AI agent.

Some basic counter-measures are urgent. Parents should think twice before entrusting their child to a word-regurgitation machine, whether it is sewn into a bear or not. Chatbots should have age restrictions that are properly enforced; governments should not give ai firms the leeway they gave social networks, which are only now being cajoled into age-gating. Teachers are kidding themselves if they think essays written at home can any longer be trusted. In the age of AI, more in-school assessment is essential.

The longer-term challenge is to think deeply about how to preserve the socialisation that AI could rub out of children’s lives. Schools, where much of childhood plays out, are the best place to do this. They should take 

advantage of personalised tuition where it is proven to work. But they must also redouble efforts to teach things that a robot can’t: to debate, to disagree and to get along with—perhaps even to appreciate—people who are not as sycophantic as a chatbot.

Schools should also enhance their role as centres of discovery. If AI is giving children more of what they want, it is more important that schools provide chances to meet people and encounter ideas that lie outside their experience. Algorithmic personalisation threatens to be a powerful barrier to social mobility if it nudges people to stay in the lane in which they start out. Inequality could widen if poor schools merely embrace chatbots as cheap substitutes for human teachers.

AI shows undeniable potential to improve education and enrich entertainment. It may one day let every child live like royalty. But the truly privileged may be those whose parents and teachers know when to turn it off. 

# 人工智能如何重塑童年  
**——这项技术带来了令人眼花缭乱的机会，也带来了不祥的风险**

今年的圣诞袜恐怕会比以往更加“会说话”。孩子们拆开礼物时，可能会发现里面装着能主动回应的玩具。中国玩具厂商已宣布2025年为“人工智能年”，正在量产能教学、陪玩、讲故事的机器人和智能泰迪熊。与此同时，大龄儿童正沉迷于爆火的AI短视频和AI加持的游戏；在学校里，许多孩子的教材是用ChatGPT这类工具生成的，甚至有人开始与聊天机器人家教并肩学习。

无论学习还是娱乐，AI正在彻底重塑童年。它承诺让每个孩子都能拥有过去只有富人才负担得起的成长体验：专属私教、完全个性化课程、量身定制的娱乐。孩子们可以听为他们量身创作的歌曲，读以自己为主角的故事，玩会根据个人水平自动调整难度的游戏，还能拥有一群随时鼓掌叫好的聊天机器人朋友。王室级别的童年，有望变成普惠现实。

这是一个充满机会的未来——同时也布满隐秘陷阱。正如真正的国王常常发现的那样，完全定制化的成长也可能是孤独而原子化的。更糟糕的是，正如臣民们常常体会到的，这种成长会培养出无法适应现实生活的成年人。随着AI在好与坏两个方向上改变童年，整个社会都必须重新思考“把孩子养大”这件事。

被机器人带大的确有优势。科技公司已经在展示AI如何在师资和教材匮乏的地区显著提升学习效果。早期试验表明，识字率和语言学习都有明显进步。梦想是：有了AI家教，孩子们再也不用上“一刀切”、面向中间水平的课堂——聪明的孩子不会无聊，学得慢的孩子也不会掉队。如果你想把这篇社论改写成适合8岁印地语孩子的版本，AI分分钟搞定；要是孩子更喜欢漫画条或儿歌形式，也完全没问题。

技术也在创造全新的乐趣。好莱坞或许把AI视频贬为“垃圾内容”（slop），但年轻人正疯狂消费并自己动手制作。老玩具也在升级：AI版《Trivia Pursuit》（知识问答）可以就任何主题出题。电子游戏带来前所未有的体验，比如在《Fortnite》里和达斯·维达聊天。任何孩子都能见到自己的偶像——然后一枪崩了对方。

让孩子随意接触一项仍在快速演化的技术，风险早已被广泛报道。AI家教可能会“幻觉”出错误答案；玩具也可能失控——家长拆圣诞袜时要当心，最近就有一款AI泰迪熊被发现用露骨性话题“调戏”孩子。孩子们也很容易滥用AI：用它写作业作弊，或者用“深度伪造”视频互相霸凌。聊天机器人甚至可能诱导脆弱的青少年自残。科技公司坚称这些都是可以修补的“小插曲”——毕竟ChatGPT才诞生三年。

然而，对童年最剧烈的颠覆，可能恰恰来自AI“完全按设计正常运行”的时候。这项技术会迅速学会主人喜欢什么，然后投其所好、只呈现更多同类内容。社交媒体早就造出了回音室，让人只看到自己认同（或痛恨）的观点。AI会把这种回音室进一步加固，而且从儿童时期就开始锁死。一个喜欢足球的孩子，可能被泰迪熊讲的全是足球故事，被AI家教举的全是足球例子。这不仅彻底扼杀了意外之喜（serendipity），更可怕的是，孩子根本不必再学习如何忍受不熟悉的事物。

与聊天机器人的单向关系也带来类似风险。永远不批评、也从不表达自己情绪的AI伴侣，是与真实、充满缺陷的人类相处的糟糕预演。美国三分之一的青少年表示，和AI伴侣聊天至少和跟朋友聊天一样满足，甚至比跟父母聊天更容易。这样的“是男人”（Yes-bot）可能养出不懂得轮流、不懂得妥协的孩子，长大后成为无法协作的同事、不会经营亲密关系的伴侣。

其他社会趋势也在往同一方向推波助澜。生育率暴跌，越来越少的孩子有兄弟姐妹帮他们磨平棱角；越来越多的年轻人觉得长期恋爱关系“太麻烦不值得”；远程办公让在个性化、反社会环境中长大的人，可以直接滑入只需要对着屏幕、甚至很快就能交给AI代理完成的工作。

一些最基本的应对措施已迫在眉睫。  
家长要把孩子交给一台“只会吐词的机器”之前务必三思，不管这台机器是不是缝在毛绒熊里。聊天机器人必须设立严格执行的年龄限制；政府绝不能像当年对待社交网络那样给AI公司留出巨大灰色地带——社交平台直到今天才被迫加上年龄门。老师如果还以为学生在家写的作文可信，那就是自欺欺人。在AI时代，必须大幅增加校内考试和评估。

更长远的挑战在于：深刻思考如何保留AI可能彻底抹除的儿童社会化过程。学校——童年大部分时间发生的地方——是最佳战场。学校应当在个性化教学确实有效的地方大胆使用AI，但同时必须加倍努力教那些机器人永远教不了的东西：如何辩论、如何不同意、如何与人相处，甚至如何欣赏那些不像聊天机器人那样谄媚的人。

学校还应强化自己作为“发现中心”的角色。如果AI在家里给孩子越来越多他们已经喜欢的东西，那么学校就更有义务提供接触不同人群、不同思想的机会。算法个性化如果只是不断把人推向自己出发的车道，将成为社会流动性的强大障碍。贫穷学校的孩子如果只能用聊天机器人当廉价老师替代品，不平等只会进一步拉大。

人工智能在改善教育、丰富娱乐方面展现出无可否认的潜力。有一天，它或许真的能让每个孩子都过上“王室级别”的童年。  
但真正拥有特权的，可能恰恰是那些父母和老师懂得什么时候把它关掉的孩子。
