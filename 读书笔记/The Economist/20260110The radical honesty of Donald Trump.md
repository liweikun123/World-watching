# The radical honesty of Donald Trump

Why the world will miss hypocrisy in American foreign policy

Although Donald Trump lies a lot, even by the standards of American presidents, a bleak, transgressive honesty about how the world really works has always been core to his peculiar political appeal: politicians are corrupted by big donations; only stupid people pay higher taxes than they can get away with; he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose a vote. “You think our country’s so innocent?” he once replied when asked about the murderous record of Vladimir Putin.

Mr Trump’s forthrightness about his interest in Venezuela is of a piece with this politics and worldview. He is not intent on regime change, let alone on spreading democracy. In fact, he seems content with regime stabilisation, as long as the regime recognises America is “in charge”, because what he wants most is the oil. “We’re going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground,” Mr Trump said after American forces snatched the country’s despotic leader, Nicolás Maduro.

Because gaps between a politician’s stated principles and his actions supply the easiest targets for his critics, Mr Trump’s unabashed cynicism lends him a shield. Some may whinge that Mr Trump is violating his “America First” standards, but on this point he is no hypocrite. To him, the slogan does not imply isolationism. It licenses American aggression in pursuit of naked self-interest.

Other objections to Mr Trump’s lightning strike seem even less likely to gain purchase. Democrats may keep complaining he violated the constitution by assuming Congress’s authority to declare war, but so what? Presidents have been doing that for well over a century. A Congress that could not bestir itself to restrain Mr Trump from executing anonymous suspected drug-runners, without producing any evidence, is not likely to impeach him for going to such lengths to bring an indicted cocaine lord to justice (however at odds those tactics may be—and even though Mr Trump had previously pardoned a convicted drug lord, the former president of Honduras, for smuggling cocaine from Venezuela).

Appeals to international law seem even more pathetic. Yes, the United Nations charter rules out violating another nation’s sovereignty by force, unless approved by the Security Council. But there’s a carve-out for actions in self-defence—the very argument, as it happens, the Trump administration is making, absurdly. More important, who can hope to enforce such law against America?

At home and abroad, longtime critics of American foreign policy may even take some satisfaction from Mr Trump’s bluntness. America has not been “so innocent” in dozens of interventions in Latin America during the cold war, waiving concern for human rights or democracy when American commerce and control were actually, or also, at stake. Such critics may console themselves—as so many of this president’s supporters have for so long—that Mr Trump, though coarse, is telling it as it is.

While the administration of Barack Obama declared the Monroe Doctrine defunct, Mr Trump has not merely revived it but, in his 2025 National Security Strategy, appended a “Trump corollary”, since rebranded, clumsily, the “Donroe doctrine”. Beyond the old doctrine’s prohibition against European colonisation in the hemisphere, the corollary asserts an American imperative for commercial pre-eminence. As ever with Mr Trump, those countries that have come to rely most on America are his low-hanging fruit: “especially with those countries that depend on us most and therefore over which we have the most leverage”, America must insist on “sole-source contracts for our companies”.

Promoting democracy or human rights does not rate a mention. “We must not overlook governments with different outlooks with whom we nonetheless share interests,” the strategy cautions, in a line that may have foretold the new Venezuela. One noun best captures Mr Trump’s vision of America’s proper role in the Americas, and he used it freely on January 3rd, during his press conference describing Mr Maduro’s capture: “America’s dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again,” he said.

Maybe this will all work out well. More likely, in years to come, everyone, including America, will come to miss the old hypocrisy. International law has rarely operated via enforcement, but rather via voluntary compliance, with America, for all its failings, carrying the standard. What happens when vice no longer feels any compulsion to pay homage to virtue? It is troubling enough to consider how not just Russia and China but smaller nations might behave, let alone America, as it forthrightly—honestly—owns the role of apex predator. Not just Colombia and Cuba but Mexico and Denmark have every reason to take Mr Trump’s threats seriously. He may not always use military force but he will use every other means of leverage an American president has, without regard for consequences after his own term in office.

These days, defending the principles of international law seems so futile that doing so seems uncool. Mr Trump demonstrates daily that what matters, in the real world, is power—at least, that is all that matters when the American president believes that’s all that matters. Yet the claim that this will make America safer and more prosperous in the long haul is his biggest delusion. The Americans who led the world to put those rules in place after the second world war were not misty-eyed romantics. They were hardened realists such as Arthur Vandenberg, a Republican senator from Michigan and former isolationist who recognised that in a globalising age “our oceans have ceased to be moats” and only a new “enlightened self-interest” could avert mayhem. These leaders were distilling the lessons from horrors that subsequent generations of Americans, and much of the world, have been spared, and probably not by coincidence. ■
