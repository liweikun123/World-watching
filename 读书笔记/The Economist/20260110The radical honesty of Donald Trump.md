# The radical honesty of Donald Trump

Why the world will miss hypocrisy in American foreign policy

Although Donald Trump lies a lot, even by the standards of American presidents, a bleak, transgressive honesty about how the world really works has always been core to his peculiar political appeal: politicians are corrupted by big donations; only stupid people pay higher taxes than they can get away with; he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose a vote. “You think our country’s so innocent?” he once replied when asked about the murderous record of Vladimir Putin.

Mr Trump’s forthrightness about his interest in Venezuela is of a piece with this politics and worldview. He is not intent on regime change, let alone on spreading democracy. In fact, he seems content with regime stabilisation, as long as the regime recognises America is “in charge”, because what he wants most is the oil. “We’re going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground,” Mr Trump said after American forces snatched the country’s despotic leader, Nicolás Maduro.

Because gaps between a politician’s stated principles and his actions supply the easiest targets for his critics, Mr Trump’s unabashed cynicism lends him a shield. Some may whinge that Mr Trump is violating his “America First” standards, but on this point he is no hypocrite. To him, the slogan does not imply isolationism. It licenses American aggression in pursuit of naked self-interest.

Other objections to Mr Trump’s lightning strike seem even less likely to gain purchase. Democrats may keep complaining he violated the constitution by assuming Congress’s authority to declare war, but so what? Presidents have been doing that for well over a century. A Congress that could not bestir itself to restrain Mr Trump from executing anonymous suspected drug-runners, without producing any evidence, is not likely to impeach him for going to such lengths to bring an indicted cocaine lord to justice (however at odds those tactics may be—and even though Mr Trump had previously pardoned a convicted drug lord, the former president of Honduras, for smuggling cocaine from Venezuela).

Appeals to international law seem even more pathetic. Yes, the United Nations charter rules out violating another nation’s sovereignty by force, unless approved by the Security Council. But there’s a carve-out for actions in self-defence—the very argument, as it happens, the Trump administration is making, absurdly. More important, who can hope to enforce such law against America?

At home and abroad, longtime critics of American foreign policy may even take some satisfaction from Mr Trump’s bluntness. America has not been “so innocent” in dozens of interventions in Latin America during the cold war, waiving concern for human rights or democracy when American commerce and control were actually, or also, at stake. Such critics may console themselves—as so many of this president’s supporters have for so long—that Mr Trump, though coarse, is telling it as it is.

While the administration of Barack Obama declared the Monroe Doctrine defunct, Mr Trump has not merely revived it but, in his 2025 National Security Strategy, appended a “Trump corollary”, since rebranded, clumsily, the “Donroe doctrine”. Beyond the old doctrine’s prohibition against European colonisation in the hemisphere, the corollary asserts an American imperative for commercial pre-eminence. As ever with Mr Trump, those countries that have come to rely most on America are his low-hanging fruit: “especially with those countries that depend on us most and therefore over which we have the most leverage”, America must insist on “sole-source contracts for our companies”.

Promoting democracy or human rights does not rate a mention. “We must not overlook governments with different outlooks with whom we nonetheless share interests,” the strategy cautions, in a line that may have foretold the new Venezuela. One noun best captures Mr Trump’s vision of America’s proper role in the Americas, and he used it freely on January 3rd, during his press conference describing Mr Maduro’s capture: “America’s dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again,” he said.

Maybe this will all work out well. More likely, in years to come, everyone, including America, will come to miss the old hypocrisy. International law has rarely operated via enforcement, but rather via voluntary compliance, with America, for all its failings, carrying the standard. What happens when vice no longer feels any compulsion to pay homage to virtue? It is troubling enough to consider how not just Russia and China but smaller nations might behave, let alone America, as it forthrightly—honestly—owns the role of apex predator. Not just Colombia and Cuba but Mexico and Denmark have every reason to take Mr Trump’s threats seriously. He may not always use military force but he will use every other means of leverage an American president has, without regard for consequences after his own term in office.

These days, defending the principles of international law seems so futile that doing so seems uncool. Mr Trump demonstrates daily that what matters, in the real world, is power—at least, that is all that matters when the American president believes that’s all that matters. Yet the claim that this will make America safer and more prosperous in the long haul is his biggest delusion. The Americans who led the world to put those rules in place after the second world war were not misty-eyed romantics. They were hardened realists such as Arthur Vandenberg, a Republican senator from Michigan and former isolationist who recognised that in a globalising age “our oceans have ceased to be moats” and only a new “enlightened self-interest” could avert mayhem. These leaders were distilling the lessons from horrors that subsequent generations of Americans, and much of the world, have been spared, and probably not by coincidence. ■

# The radical honesty of Donald Trump

## Original English Text + Chinese Translation

### Title (标题)
**English:** The radical honesty of Donald Trump  
**Chinese:** 唐纳德·特朗普的激进诚实

### Subtitle (副标题)
**English:** Why the world will miss hypocrisy in American foreign policy  
**Chinese:** 为什么世界会怀念美国外交政策中的虚伪

### Paragraph 1
**English:** Although Donald Trump lies a lot, even by the standards of American presidents, a bleak, transgressive honesty about how the world really works has always been core to his peculiar political appeal: politicians are corrupted by big donations; only stupid people pay higher taxes than they can get away with; he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose a vote. “You think our country’s so innocent?” he once replied when asked about the murderous record of Vladimir Putin.  
**Chinese:** 尽管唐纳德·特朗普撒了很多谎，即使按照美国总统的标准也是如此，但一种关于世界真正如何运作的阴郁、越界的诚实一直是其独特政治吸引力的核心：政客们被大额捐款腐蚀；只有愚蠢的人才会支付高于他们能逃避的税款；他可以在第五大道上射杀某人而不丢失一张选票。“你认为我们的国家那么无辜吗？”当被问及弗拉基米尔·普京的谋杀记录时，他曾经这样回复。

### Paragraph 2
**English:** Mr Trump’s forthrightness about his interest in Venezuela is of a piece with this politics and worldview. He is not intent on regime change, let alone on spreading democracy. In fact, he seems content with regime stabilisation, as long as the regime recognises America is “in charge”, because what he wants most is the oil. “We’re going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground,” Mr Trump said after American forces snatched the country’s despotic leader, Nicolás Maduro.  
**Chinese:** 特朗普先生对委内瑞拉兴趣的直率与这种政治和世界观是一致的。他无意于政权更迭，更不用说传播民主了。事实上，他似乎满足于政权稳定，只要该政权承认美国“掌权”，因为他最想要的是石油。“我们将从地下取出巨额财富，”特朗普先生在美国军队抓获该国专制领导人尼古拉斯·马杜罗后说道。

### Paragraph 3
**English:** Because gaps between a politician’s stated principles and his actions supply the easiest targets for his critics, Mr Trump’s unabashed cynicism lends him a shield. Some may whinge that Mr Trump is violating his “America First” standards, but on this point he is no hypocrite. To him, the slogan does not imply isolationism. It licenses American aggression in pursuit of naked self-interest.  
**Chinese:** 因为政客陈述的原则与其行动之间的差距为批评者提供了最容易的目标，特朗普先生毫不掩饰的犬儒主义给他提供了一个盾牌。有些人可能抱怨特朗普先生违反了他的“美国优先”标准，但在这点上他不是伪君子。对他来说，这个口号并不意味着孤立主义。它授权美国为追求赤裸裸的自利而进行侵略。

### Paragraph 4
**English:** Other objections to Mr Trump’s lightning strike seem even less likely to gain purchase. Democrats may keep complaining he violated the constitution by assuming Congress’s authority to declare war, but so what? Presidents have been doing that for well over a century. A Congress that could not bestir itself to restrain Mr Trump from executing anonymous suspected drug-runners, without producing any evidence, is not likely to impeach him for going to such lengths to bring an indicted cocaine lord to justice (however at odds those tactics may be—and even though Mr Trump had previously pardoned a convicted drug lord, the former president of Honduras, for smuggling cocaine from Venezuela).  
**Chinese:** 对特朗普先生闪电袭击的其他反对意见似乎更不可能获得支持。民主党人可能继续抱怨他通过假设国会宣战的权力违反了宪法，但那又怎样？总统们已经这样做了一个多世纪。一个无法鼓起劲来阻止特朗普先生在没有提供任何证据的情况下处决匿名涉嫌毒贩的国会，不太可能弹劾他，因为他不惜一切手段将一名被起诉的可卡因大王绳之以法（无论这些策略多么不一致——尽管特朗普先生此前曾赦免一名被定罪的毒枭，即前洪都拉斯总统，从委内瑞拉走私可卡因）。

### Paragraph 5
**English:** Appeals to international law seem even more pathetic. Yes, the United Nations charter rules out violating another nation’s sovereignty by force, unless approved by the Security Council. But there’s a carve-out for actions in self-defence—the very argument, as it happens, the Trump administration is making, absurdly. More important, who can hope to enforce such law against America?  
**Chinese:** 对国际法的诉求似乎更加可悲。是的，联合国宪章禁止以武力侵犯另一国主权，除非得到安理会的批准。但有一个自卫行动的例外——恰好是特朗普政府荒谬地提出的论点。更重要的是，谁能希望对美国执行这样的法律？

### Paragraph 6
**English:** At home and abroad, longtime critics of American foreign policy may even take some satisfaction from Mr Trump’s bluntness. America has not been “so innocent” in dozens of interventions in Latin America during the cold war, waiving concern for human rights or democracy when American commerce and control were actually, or also, at stake. Such critics may console themselves—as so many of this president’s supporters have for so long—that Mr Trump, though coarse, is telling it as it is.  
**Chinese:** 在国内外，美国外交政策的长期批评者甚至可能从特朗普先生的直率中获得一些满足。美国在冷战期间对拉丁美洲的数十次干预中并不“那么无辜”，当美国商业和控制真正或同时处于危险中时，放弃了对人权或民主的关注。此类批评者可能安慰自己——就像这位总统的许多支持者长期以来所做的那样——特朗普先生虽然粗鲁，但是在说实话。

### Paragraph 7
**English:** While the administration of Barack Obama declared the Monroe Doctrine defunct, Mr Trump has not merely revived it but, in his 2025 National Security Strategy, appended a “Trump corollary”, since rebranded, clumsily, the “Donroe doctrine”. Beyond the old doctrine’s prohibition against European colonisation in the hemisphere, the corollary asserts an American imperative for commercial pre-eminence. As ever with Mr Trump, those countries that have come to rely most on America are his low-hanging fruit: “especially with those countries that depend on us most and therefore over which we have the most leverage”, America must insist on “sole-source contracts for our companies”.  
**Chinese:** 虽然巴拉克·奥巴马政府宣布门罗主义已失效，但特朗普先生不仅复兴了它，而且在其2025年国家安全战略中附加了一个“特朗普推论”，后来笨拙地改名为“唐罗主义”。除了旧主义对欧洲在该半球殖民的禁止外，该推论断言美国对商业霸权的必要性。正如特朗普先生一贯如此，那些最依赖美国的国家是他的低垂果实：“特别是那些最依赖我们的国家，因此我们对其有最大影响力”，美国必须坚持“为我们公司提供独家合同”。

### Paragraph 8
**English:** Promoting democracy or human rights does not rate a mention. “We must not overlook governments with different outlooks with whom we nonetheless share interests,” the strategy cautions, in a line that may have foretold the new Venezuela. One noun best captures Mr Trump’s vision of America’s proper role in the Americas, and he used it freely on January 3rd, during his press conference describing Mr Maduro’s capture: “America’s dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again,” he said.  
**Chinese:** 促进民主或人权没有被提及。“我们不能忽略那些尽管观点不同但我们共享利益的政府，”该战略警告道，这一行可能预示了新的委内瑞拉。一个名词最好捕捉特朗普先生对美国在美洲适当角色的愿景，他在1月3日描述马杜罗被捕的新闻发布会上自由使用了它：“美国在西半球的支配地位将永不再被质疑，”他说。

### Paragraph 9
**English:** Maybe this will all work out well. More likely, in years to come, everyone, including America, will come to miss the old hypocrisy. International law has rarely operated via enforcement, but rather via voluntary compliance, with America, for all its failings, carrying the standard. What happens when vice no longer feels any compulsion to pay homage to virtue? It is troubling enough to consider how not just Russia and China but smaller nations might behave, let alone America, as it forthrightly—honestly—owns the role of apex predator. Not just Colombia and Cuba but Mexico and Denmark have every reason to take Mr Trump’s threats seriously. He may not always use military force but he will use every other means of leverage an American president has, without regard for consequences after his own term in office.  
**Chinese:** 也许这一切都会顺利进行。更可能的是，在未来的几年里，每个人，包括美国，都会怀念旧的虚伪。国际法很少通过强制执行运作，而是通过自愿遵守，美国尽管有其缺陷，但一直扛着标准。当恶习不再感到有必要向美德致敬时会发生什么？这已经足够令人不安，考虑不仅仅是俄罗斯和中国，还有小国可能如何行事，更不用说美国了，因为它直率地——诚实地——拥有顶级捕食者的角色。不仅仅是哥伦比亚和古巴，还有墨西哥和丹麦都有充分理由认真对待特朗普先生的威胁。他可能不总是使用军事力量，但他会使用美国总统拥有的所有其他杠杆手段，而不考虑他自己任期后的后果。

### Paragraph 10
**English:** These days, defending the principles of international law seems so futile that doing so seems uncool. Mr Trump demonstrates daily that what matters, in the real world, is power—at least, that is all that matters when the American president believes that’s all that matters. Yet the claim that this will make America safer and more prosperous in the long haul is his biggest delusion. The Americans who led the world to put those rules in place after the second world war were not misty-eyed romantics. They were hardened realists such as Arthur Vandenberg, a Republican senator from Michigan and former isolationist who recognised that in a globalising age “our oceans have ceased to be moats” and only a new “enlightened self-interest” could avert mayhem. These leaders were distilling the lessons from horrors that subsequent generations of Americans, and much of the world, have been spared, and probably not by coincidence. ■  
**Chinese:** 如今，捍卫国际法原则似乎如此徒劳，以至于这样做似乎不酷。特朗普先生每天都证明，在现实世界中重要的是权力——至少，当美国总统相信那就是一切时，那就是一切。然而，这种说法，即这将使美国在长远中更安全和更繁荣，是他最大的妄想。二战后领导世界制定这些规则的美国人不是朦胧的浪漫主义者。他们是像密歇根州共和党参议员、前孤立主义者亚瑟·范登伯格这样的硬化现实主义者，他认识到在全球化时代“我们的大洋不再是护城河”，只有一种新的“开明的自利”才能避免混乱。这些领导人是从恐怖中提炼教训，后续几代美国人和世界大部分地区都被免除了这些恐怖，而且可能不是巧合。■
