# Does Japan have a “foreigner problem”?

JAPAN is consumed by talk of a “foreigner problem”. The story goes that the country has been overrun by ill-mannered migrant workers, misbehaving tourists and opportunistic foreign investors. But Japan’s real problem is not that it hosts too many foreigners. It is that it has too few.

Foreigners moved to the centre of political debate after the upstart Do It Yourself (Sanseito) party rode a “Japanese first” platform to big gains in last year’s upper-house election. In October the panicked ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) chose as its new leader Takaichi Sanae, who launched her campaign for the job by lambasting foreign tourists who, she said without evidence, had been “kicking” sacred deer in Nara, an ancient capital. In Japan’s polite political culture, this was nearly as provocative as Donald Trump’s false claim that Haitian immigrants were eating American pets.

Since becoming prime minister, Ms Takaichi has proposed tightening the screws on foreigners in the hope of winning voters back to the LDP. Her administration has talked of crackdowns on people who overstay visas, taxes on tourists, restrictions on property purchases and caps on foreign labour. A package of measures may be put forward later this month.

Vilifying outsiders may make for good politics. But in the long run it is misguided. The true causes of voters’ frustrations are economic struggles. Cracking down on foreigners will not heal the underlying malaise. If anything, it will make it worse.

The backdrop is demographic change. Japan’s population is expected to decrease by 30% to 87m in 2070. Ms Takaichi’s mentor, the late Abe Shinzo, recognised that Japan needed to open up if it was to keep thriving. When he served as prime minister he let in more migrant workers and encouraged tourism. The number of foreign residents in Japan has doubled since 2010 to 3.7m. The number of foreign visitors has quadrupled over the same period, reaching some 40m last year.

Many foreigners live in Japan on temporary work visas. Such programmes are better than no immigration at all. But in Japan, where migrants are often treated as expendable cogs, not people who might settle and have families, such schemes hold back integration, which in turn causes tension. And as the foreign population in Japan has risen, mainstream politicians have often been reluctant to talk about it. That has helped populists paint the arrivals as a “silent invasion”.

Some popular worries reflect real problems that can be fixed. Stricter oversight of foreign investors who buy land next to sensitive sites such as military bases is wise. Imposing Japanese-language requirements for permanent residence is reasonable, too. Over-tourism has turned Kyoto’s best-known temples into mosh pits during cherry-blossom season.

# Does Japan have a “foreigner problem”?

## Original English Text + Chinese Translation

### Title (标题)
**English:** Does Japan have a “foreigner problem”?  
**Chinese:** 日本是否有“外国人问题”？

### Paragraph 1
**English:** JAPAN is consumed by talk of a “foreigner problem”. The story goes that the country has been overrun by ill-mannered migrant workers, misbehaving tourists and opportunistic foreign investors. But Japan’s real problem is not that it hosts too many foreigners. It is that it has too few.  
**Chinese:** 日本被“外国人问题”的讨论所困扰。故事是说，这个国家已经被举止粗鲁的移民工人、行为不当的游客和投机取巧的外国投资者所淹没。但日本的真正问题不是它接待了太多的外国人，而是太少了。

### Paragraph 2
**English:** Foreigners moved to the centre of political debate after the upstart Do It Yourself (Sanseito) party rode a “Japanese first” platform to big gains in last year’s upper-house election. In October the panicked ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) chose as its new leader Takaichi Sanae, who launched her campaign for the job by lambasting foreign tourists who, she said without evidence, had been “kicking” sacred deer in Nara, an ancient capital. In Japan’s polite political culture, this was nearly as provocative as Donald Trump’s false claim that Haitian immigrants were eating American pets.  
**Chinese:** 在新兴的“自己动手”（参政党）党凭借“日本人优先”平台在上年上议院选举中大获全胜后，外国人成为政治辩论的中心。10月，惊慌的执政自由民主党（LDP）选择了高市早苗作为其新领导人，她在竞选职位时猛烈抨击外国游客，她毫无证据地说，这些游客在古都奈良“踢”神圣的鹿。在日本礼貌的政治文化中，这几乎与唐纳德·特朗普虚假声称海地移民在吃美国宠物一样具有挑衅性。

### Paragraph 3
**English:** Since becoming prime minister, Ms Takaichi has proposed tightening the screws on foreigners in the hope of winning voters back to the LDP. Her administration has talked of crackdowns on people who overstay visas, taxes on tourists, restrictions on property purchases and caps on foreign labour. A package of measures may be put forward later this month.  
**Chinese:** 自成为首相以来，高市女士提议加强对外国人的控制，以期赢得选民回归自民党。她的政府谈到打击签证逾期滞留者、对游客征税、限制房产购买以及对外籍劳工设限。本月晚些时候可能提出一揽子措施。

### Paragraph 4
**English:** Vilifying outsiders may make for good politics. But in the long run it is misguided. The true causes of voters’ frustrations are economic struggles. Cracking down on foreigners will not heal the underlying malaise. If anything, it will make it worse.  
**Chinese:** 诋毁外来者可能有助于政治。但从长远来看，这是误导性的。选民不满的真正原因是经济困境。打击外国人不会治愈潜在的不适。如果有什么影响的话，它会让情况更糟。

### Paragraph 5
**English:** The backdrop is demographic change. Japan’s population is expected to decrease by 30% to 87m in 2070. Ms Takaichi’s mentor, the late Abe Shinzo, recognised that Japan needed to open up if it was to keep thriving. When he served as prime minister he let in more migrant workers and encouraged tourism. The number of foreign residents in Japan has doubled since 2010 to 3.7m. The number of foreign visitors has quadrupled over the same period, reaching some 40m last year.  
**Chinese:** 背景是人口变化。日本人口预计到2070年将减少30%至8700万。高市女士的导师、已故安倍晋三认识到，如果日本要继续繁荣，就需要开放。在他担任首相时，他允许更多移民工人进入并鼓励旅游。自2010年以来，日本的外籍居民数量翻了一番，达到370万。同期的外国游客数量增加了四倍，去年达到约4000万。

### Paragraph 6
**English:** Many foreigners live in Japan on temporary work visas. Such programmes are better than no immigration at all. But in Japan, where migrants are often treated as expendable cogs, not people who might settle and have families, such schemes hold back integration, which in turn causes tension. And as the foreign population in Japan has risen, mainstream politicians have often been reluctant to talk about it. That has helped populists paint the arrivals as a “silent invasion”.  
**Chinese:** 许多外国人以临时工作签证在日本生活。此类计划比完全没有移民要好。但在日本，移民往往被视为可消耗的齿轮，而不是可能定居并组建家庭的人，此类计划阻碍了融合，这反过来导致紧张。而且随着日本的外籍人口增加，主流政客往往不愿谈论此事。这有助于民粹主义者将这些到来者描绘成“无声入侵”。

### Paragraph 7
**English:** Some popular worries reflect real problems that can be fixed. Stricter oversight of foreign investors who buy land next to sensitive sites such as military bases is wise. Imposing Japanese-language requirements for permanent residence is reasonable, too. Over-tourism has turned Kyoto’s best-known temples into mosh pits during cherry-blossom season.  
**Chinese:** 一些流行的担忧反映了可以修复的真实问题。对购买军事基地等敏感地点附近土地的外籍投资者进行更严格的监督是明智的。为永久居留施加日语要求也是合理的。过度旅游已将京都最著名的寺庙在樱花季节变成拥挤的狂欢场所。

### Paragraph 8
**English:** But broader fears about social breakdown and loss of traditions are overstated. Japan is an island country with strong borders. It faces no surge of refugees from war or poverty. Its neighbours are either prosperous or North Korea, which locks its people in. Foreigners are only about 3% of Japan’s population; the average across the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, is 15%. And there is plenty of room for tourism to grow.  
**Chinese:** 但关于社会崩溃和传统丧失的更广泛恐惧被夸大了。日本是一个拥有强大边界的岛国。它没有面临来自战争或贫困的难民激增。其邻国要么繁荣，要么是朝鲜，后者将人民锁在里面。外国人仅占日本人口的约3%；经合组织（一个主要由富裕国家组成的俱乐部）的平均水平是15%。而且旅游业还有很大的增长空间。

### Paragraph 9
**English:** Japan already relies on foreigners in industries including hospitality, farming and nursing. Migrants help sustain many of the traditions that nativists fear losing: they catch and harvest the raw ingredients for Japanese cuisine; in some ageing rural communities they help carry portable shrines during festivals. Japan will need far more workers in the coming decades to maintain even modest growth. That is why business leaders and governors tend to favour admitting more foreigners, not fewer. As for curbing tourism, that would mean stifling Japan’s second-largest export, after cars.  
**Chinese:** 日本已经在包括酒店业、农业和护理在内的行业依赖外国人。移民帮助维持本土主义者害怕失去的许多传统：他们捕捉和收获日本料理的原料；在一些老龄化的农村社区，他们在节日期间帮助抬神轿。日本在未来几十年将需要远更多的工人来维持即使是适度的增长。这就是为什么商业领袖和地方长官倾向于接纳更多而不是更少的外国人。至于遏制旅游业，那将意味着扼杀日本仅次于汽车的第二大出口。

### Paragraph 10
**English:** Instead of discouraging tourists, Japan could lure more of them to the many beautiful places that are currently off the beaten track. (Even Kyoto has plenty of spectacular yet barely visited sites.) Instead of cracking down on foreign workers, it should design an immigration system that attracts and selects newcomers with useful skills, integrates them into society and ensures that they pay their fair share of health-care and welfare costs. The real problem is not foreigners. It is the failure to take advantage of one of Japan’s greatest strengths—that it is a wonderful place to live and work. ■  
**Chinese:** 与其劝阻游客，日本可以吸引更多游客前往目前人迹罕至的许多美丽地方。（即使是京都也有许多壮观却鲜有人访的景点。）与其打击外籍工人，它应该设计一个移民系统，吸引并选择具有有用技能的新来者，将他们融入社会，并确保他们支付公平的医疗和福利费用。真正的问题不是外国人，而是未能利用日本最大的优势之一——它是一个宜居宜业的美妙地方。■
