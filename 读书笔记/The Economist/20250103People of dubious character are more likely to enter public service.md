# People of dubious character are more likely to enter public service

According to new figures, 3.7m young Chinese sat the annual civil-service exam in November, a record. Some may not have had pristine motives for doing so. In a new working paper, John Liu of the University of Hong Kong and others use plagiarism in master’s theses to measure the level of dishonesty. Those who plagiarised more, they find, were more likely to go on to work in the public sector. Once inside they were likely to be promoted more quickly, too.

The authors come to this finding through a massive volume of data work. They trawled through 6m dissertations from CNKI, a Chinese repository of academic articles, and checked them against public records of civil-service exam-takers, identifying 120,000 civil servants and their dissertations. They used another 400,000 dissertations from non-civil servants for comparison. Messrs Liu and others ran the essays through an algorithm, producing a “plagiarism score” for each that described overlap with previous work.

The results are intriguing. People who entered the public sector had plagiarism scores that were 15.6% above the average. Customs and tax officials were the worst, with 25% and 26% higher scores than their private-sector peers. Once inside the civil service, cheaters climbed up the ranks 9% faster in the first five years of their careers than their more honest peers. From 2009 onwards plagiarism-detection software was gradually rolled out at universities across China. That reduced crooked behaviour, but those with higher scores were still more likely to enter the public sector.

The link between future dishonest behaviour and aggressive borrowing from published sources in past academic work may seem tenuous. But an experiment run by the authors seems to demonstrate that this variable reflects an enduring character trait. They invited 443 people as part of a job application to roll dice, rewarding them based on the outcome. The rolls were, however, unmonitored. People who plagiarised in their dissertations, they found, also reported improbably high rolls.

The authors explored the real-world impact of these tendencies by examining a database of 140m court rulings. Comparing the records of plagiarising judges with those of academically honest peers, they found that the cheaters were 10% more likely to favour the government over citizens in lawsuits, 15% likelier to rule for state-owned enterprises over private firms and 12% likelier to side with bigger firms than smaller ones. These judges, it seems, may have been susceptible to lobbying. When trials were livestreamed over the internet, these effects disappeared.

Performance evaluation in the civil service is notoriously subjective. Fudging metrics or sucking up to superiors may come easily to those with fewer moral scruples, which helps with promotion. Yet that does not explain why plagiarisers were more likely to enter the civil service in the first place. Worryingly for China, it may be that these people self-select into the public sector, suggests Shaoda Wang, a co-author on the paper, perhaps because they expect to thrive there. ■

**学术诚信与仕途：论文剽窃者更易进入公职体系吗？**

最新数据显示，去年11月有370万中国青年参加了年度国考，创下历史新高。然而，部分人的报考动机未必纯粹。在香港大学刘教授（John Liu）等人的一篇新工作论文中，研究者利用硕士论文的剽窃情况来衡量个人的不诚实程度。他们发现，论文剽窃程度越高的人，进入公职部门工作的可能性越大；而一旦入职，他们的晋升速度往往也更快。

作者通过海量的数据处理得出了这一结论。他们检索了中国学术论文库（知网）中的600万篇学位论文，并将其与参加公务员考试人员的公开记录进行比对，识别出了12万名公务员及其对应的论文。他们还选取了另外40万篇非公务员的论文作为对照组。刘先生等人利用算法对这些文章进行处理，为每篇论文计算出“剽窃分”，以描述其与前人作品的重合度。

研究结果耐人寻味。进入公职部门的人员，其论文剽窃分比平均水平高出15.6%。其中海关和税务官员的表现最差，得分分别比私营部门的同行高出25%和26%。在公务员系统内部，作弊者在职业生涯的前五年里，晋升速度比诚实的同行快9%。虽然从2009年起，中国各高校逐步推行了论文查重软件，减少了违规行为，但得分较高的人依然更有可能进入公职部门。

未来不诚实的行为与过去学术作品中“激进引用”文献之间的联系看似牵强，但作者进行的一项实验似乎证明，这一变量反映了一种持久的性格特征。他们邀请了443名求职者参与掷骰子测试，并根据结果发放奖励。然而，掷骰子过程无人监管。研究发现，在学位论文中剽窃的人，报告的骰子点数也高得离谱。

作者通过研究含有1.4亿份法院判决书的数据库，探讨了这些倾向在现实世界中的影响。通过对比剽窃法官与学术诚实同行的记录，他们发现，作弊者在诉讼中支持政府而非公民的可能性高出10%，支持国企而非私企的可能性高出15%，支持大企业而非小企业的可能性高出12%。这些法官似乎更容易受到游说（游说影响）。而当审判进行网络直播时，这些倾向就消失了。

公务员系统的绩效评估是出了名的主观。对于那些缺乏道德准则的人来说，伪造指标或讨好上司并非难事，这有助于他们获得晋升。然而，这并不能解释为什么剽窃者最初更有可能进入公务员队伍。对中国来说，令人担忧的一点在于，正如该论文的合著者王绍达所暗示的，这些人可能是“自我筛选”进入公职部门的，或许是因为他们预期在那里能混得风生水起。
