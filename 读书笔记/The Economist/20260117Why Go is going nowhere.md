# Why Go is going nowhere

Three masters, one game, zero consensus

When Japan’s prime minister, Takaichi Sanae, first met South Korea’s president, Lee Jae Myung, towards the end of last year, she gave him a set of Go stones as a gift. Days later, hosting China’s leader Xi Jinping in Seoul, Mr Lee delivered a comparable present: a Go board carved from rare torreya wood. That both leaders made such similar offerings should perhaps not come as a surprise: Go, one of the world’s oldest board games, enjoys special standing among three countries that otherwise find little to agree on. If only the region got on better, the precious piece of East Asia’s shared heritage might have more purchase abroad.

Go is played on a wooden grid with black and white stones. Points are scored by walling off areas of the board with your pieces, and by surrounding those of your opponent. The rules are simple; the game is not. Victory depends on foresight and the slow accumulation of influence. The game has long lent itself to metaphor. Politics and war, like Go, reward patience more than brute force.

The game was invented in China some 2,500 years ago. But Go’s modern form owes much to Japan. Under the shoguns of the Edo period, which ended in 1868, state-backed academies, ranking systems and official contests turned a pastime for scholar-warriors into a professional discipline. By the end of the second world war Japan stood unrivalled as the game’s leading power. Its confidence was such that it sent teams on exchange visits to China and South Korea, instructing players who would later become formidable rivals.

The atmosphere of that era still lingers at the Nihon Ki-in, Japan’s Go association, in central Tokyo. Its hall of fame displays photographs of Chen Yi, a Chinese marshal fond of playing with Japanese officials, alongside images of young Chinese and Korean protégés studying under Japanese masters. These pictures recall a moment when rivalry was tempered by respect.

This mood, alas, did not last. In the 1980s Chinese and South Korean players began defeating Japanese champions. That helped revive the game in their home countries and reshaped the international hierarchy. With success came money and prestige, and with those things came fiercer competition. In recent years the world of Go has found it harder to stay aloof from prickly nationalism in China, South Korea and Japan.

Tensions reached fever pitch in 2025, when a high-profile snarl-up at an international Go tournament in Seoul made board-gamers gasp. China’s Ke Jie withdrew from a title match against a South Korean rival after receiving repeated penalties for failing to place captured stones in a designated area. The rule he fell foul of had been introduced in the middle of the tournament by the South Korean Go association (to put foreigners at a disadvantage, cynics alleged).

China’s Go association raged; Go fans traded insults online. China later barred foreign players, most of them South Korean, from playing in its domestic tournaments. Cho Hye-yeon, a South Korean nine-dan (the Go equivalent of a chess grandmaster) says the incident reflected a ruthlessly competitive culture that is driven from above. “We are between Japan and China,” she argues. “We have to be very strong.”

Such squabbles exasperate Asians who worry that Go is growing irrelevant. Its audience is ageing. Commercial interest in it is ebbing. Young people are drifting towards simpler hobbies such as chess or its Japanese counterpart, shogi—and above all to computer games. Nihon Ki-in has started looking into the possible sale of its Tokyo headquarters amid mounting financial strain.

Rivalries in East Asia have reduced the scope for jointly promoting Go abroad. Nam Chi-hyung, president of the International Society of Go Studies, notes that China, Japan and South Korea cannot agree even on a common rulebook. When Go was registered with the International Mind Sports Association alongside chess and bridge, in the hope of eventual Olympic recognition, the rules adopted were mostly those of the American Go Association. The East Asian trio could not reach consensus. “It’s pride,” says Ms Nam.

One of Go’s ten “golden rules”, attributed to Wang Jixin, a Tang-dynasty master, urges players to seek peace and avoid fighting from weakness and isolation. It is a lesson that the game’s warring custodians seem unable to learn. ■
