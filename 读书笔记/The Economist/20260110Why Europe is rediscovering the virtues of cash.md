# Why Europe is rediscovering the virtues of cash

In a world of payment apps and digital euros, the coin is staging a modest comeback

Enter a church in Sweden in the bleak midwinter and you will find one of its recesses faintly aglow. A thicket of candles, lit by visitors commemorating a loved one, offers a break from the bustle of modern life. Once, such contemplative scenes were disturbed only by the sound of coins clinking into a metal box accepting donations for each candle. No longer. In these modern times, the candles remain but the cash box has often been replaced by a QR code. Instead of rummaging through their change purses, prospective candle-lighters zap a few kronor to the church through Swish, a ubiquitous payment app. The sound of coins against metal has been replaced by the dull buzz of mobile phones announcing that a payment has gone through.

Europe, or at least its northern bit, is the land that cash forgot. In Norway and Sweden coins and notes are vanishing into the past alongside Vikings and discontinued IKEA bedspreads. Swedes now use digital payments for 90% of all their purchases; only half use cash at all in any given month (Charlemagne, a frequent visitor to Sweden, has not seen a bank note there in well over a decade). Whereas the Japanese have paper and metal yen equivalent to 22% of their GDP stuffed into wallets and under mattresses (or futons), in Sweden the figure is under 1%.

Other bits of the continent are catching up. Cash more often remains the norm in southern Europe, where people are poorer and small businesses sometimes lack Scandinavians’ meticulousness in declaring all their income to the taxman. Germany and Austria have a lingering affection for physical money, valuing the privacy it offers in the face of once-repressive states. But even they are ditching cash. Europe has half as many ATMs per person as America does, and the number is falling. Banks hold so little cash in Denmark that robbers no longer bother sticking them up.

All this swishing money electronically from one account to another once looked like modernity incarnate—no matter the protests of buskers, beggars and tax-dodgers. Politicians have long pushed for more digital payments to help stamp out undeclared income and crack down on money-laundering. Greece forced businesses, including restaurants and taxis, to accept digital payments and issue receipts (although the card reader at the taverna might prove conveniently out of service when the bill arrived). The EU has mandated thresholds on cash usage, demanding national legislation banning the use of banknotes for large business payments. In 2019 the European Central Bank even stopped issuing new €500 ($584) notes. (The bill was so rarely seen, and so suspected of financing dodgy stuff, that it had become known as the “bin Laden”.) In European eyes cash was yesterday’s money, and digital payments the gleaming future.

Some protested, notably those on the populist right. They have long denigrated digital payments as a sop to banks (which profit from each card swipe); cash, they say, is a form of “printed freedom”. But consumers have voted with their wallets. Across the euro area cash was used for 79% of in-person transactions in 2016, but just 52% in 2024 (and accounted for a smaller share of value, because cards are preferred for larger payments). Coffee shops realised they could do brisker business by having punters tap their bank cards instead of shuffling bits of metal. Particularly after covid-19, payments in coins and notes became so rare in many shops as to no longer be worth it. An ever-growing number put out “no cash” signs: across Europe, 12% of all businesses flatly refused cash in 2024, up from 4% just three years earlier. In some countries the figure is higher. Over one in three cinemas in the Netherlands no longer accept notes and coins. Cash looked headed for a doom loop: fewer people were taking out euros because fewer shops accepted them, because fewer people use them, and so on.

Yet authorities now think electronic money may be too much of a good thing. They would like to see, if not a dash back to cash, then at least a way to ensure it continues as a ubiquitous means of payment. In 2021 a ruling from the top EU court affirmed that paper money should in principle be accepted. To remove all remaining doubt, in December ministers from the EU’s 27 member states reiterated their desire to ban businesses from refusing notes and coins. As part of a forthcoming law, shops and restaurants will still be able to indicate they prefer digital payments, but will need also to accept old-fashioned cash.

Why the seeming backtrack? One concern is that a sizeable minority are still digitally averse. Newfangled apps and PIN-locked cards are great for young and connected types, and tolerable for the middle-aged and mildly hapless. But for the elderly the experience of juggling bank cards and apps can be frustrating. Some poor people struggle to open bank accounts at all.

A more recent misgiving centres on the resilience of payment systems. Convenient as they are when things work well, getting money to move around ethereally requires electricity and a data connection. Spaniards facing nationwide power cuts last spring found themselves unable to buy food and other necessities. And what of threats from foreign adversaries? Some fret that too much digital payment leaves Europe dependent on the likes of Visa and MasterCard, American firms with unpredictable political masters. (The ECB is mulling a “digital euro” in response, though that will take years.) In the Baltics and Nordics, where angst focuses on Russian sabotage, digital payments systems now work for a time even when power is cut. But nothing beats cash when it comes to resilience. Swedes have long been advised to store enough in notes and coins to get through a week, a move the EU now recommends. After years of tapping and swiping to pay, Europe is discovering that some change is worth keeping. ■

# Why Europe is rediscovering the virtues of cash

## Original English Text + Chinese Translation

### Title (标题)
**English:** Why Europe is rediscovering the virtues of cash  
**Chinese:** 为什么欧洲正在重新发现现金的美德

### Subtitle (副标题)
**English:** In a world of payment apps and digital euros, the coin is staging a modest comeback  
**Chinese:** 在支付应用和数字欧元的世界中，硬币正在 modest 地卷土重来

### Paragraph 1
**English:** Enter a church in Sweden in the bleak midwinter and you will find one of its recesses faintly aglow. A thicket of candles, lit by visitors commemorating a loved one, offers a break from the bustle of modern life. Once, such contemplative scenes were disturbed only by the sound of coins clinking into a metal box accepting donations for each candle. No longer. In these modern times, the candles remain but the cash box has often been replaced by a QR code. Instead of rummaging through their change purses, prospective candle-lighters zap a few kronor to the church through Swish, a ubiquitous payment app. The sound of coins against metal has been replaced by the dull buzz of mobile phones announcing that a payment has gone through.  
**Chinese:** 在寒冷的仲冬进入瑞典的一座教堂，你会发现它的一个凹处微微发光。一簇蜡烛，由访客点亮以纪念亲人，提供了一个脱离现代生活喧嚣的喘息机会。曾经，这样的沉思场景仅被硬币叮当作响投入接受每支蜡烛捐赠的金属盒子的声音打扰。不再是这样了。在这些现代时代，蜡烛仍然存在，但现金盒子往往被二维码取代。潜在的点蜡烛者不再翻找他们的零钱包，而是通过Swish这个无处不在的支付应用向教堂转几克朗。硬币撞击金属的声音已被手机发出支付已完成的单调嗡嗡声取代。

### Paragraph 2
**English:** Europe, or at least its northern bit, is the land that cash forgot. In Norway and Sweden coins and notes are vanishing into the past alongside Vikings and discontinued IKEA bedspreads. Swedes now use digital payments for 90% of all their purchases; only half use cash at all in any given month (Charlemagne, a frequent visitor to Sweden, has not seen a bank note there in well over a decade). Whereas the Japanese have paper and metal yen equivalent to 22% of their GDP stuffed into wallets and under mattresses (or futons), in Sweden the figure is under 1%.  
**Chinese:** 欧洲，或者至少它的北部，是现金被遗忘的土地。在挪威和瑞典，硬币和纸币正与维京人和停产的宜家床罩一起消失在过去。瑞典人现在使用数字支付进行90%的所有购买；只有一半人在任何一个月使用现金（查理曼大帝，一位经常访问瑞典的人，已经十多年没在那里见过钞票了）。而日本人有相当于其GDP 22%的纸币和金属日元塞进钱包和床垫下（或蒲团下），在瑞典这个数字不到1%。

### Paragraph 3
**English:** Other bits of the continent are catching up. Cash more often remains the norm in southern Europe, where people are poorer and small businesses sometimes lack Scandinavians’ meticulousness in declaring all their income to the taxman. Germany and Austria have a lingering affection for physical money, valuing the privacy it offers in the face of once-repressive states. But even they are ditching cash. Europe has half as many ATMs per person as America does, and the number is falling. Banks hold so little cash in Denmark that robbers no longer bother sticking them up.  
**Chinese:** 大陆的其他部分正在赶上。在南欧，现金更常仍是常态，那里的人更穷，小企业有时缺乏斯堪的纳维亚人在向税务局申报所有收入时的细致性。德国和奥地利对实体货币有持久的喜爱，重视它在面对曾经压迫性的国家时提供的隐私。但即使他们也在抛弃现金。欧洲人均ATM机数量只有美国的一半，而且这个数字正在下降。丹麦的银行持有如此少的现金，以至于抢劫犯不再费心抢劫它们。

### Paragraph 4
**English:** All this swishing money electronically from one account to another once looked like modernity incarnate—no matter the protests of buskers, beggars and tax-dodgers. Politicians have long pushed for more digital payments to help stamp out undeclared income and crack down on money-laundering. Greece forced businesses, including restaurants and taxis, to accept digital payments and issue receipts (although the card reader at the taverna might prove conveniently out of service when the bill arrived). The EU has mandated thresholds on cash usage, demanding national legislation banning the use of banknotes for large business payments. In 2019 the European Central Bank even stopped issuing new €500 ($584) notes. (The bill was so rarely seen, and so suspected of financing dodgy stuff, that it had become known as the “bin Laden”.) In European eyes cash was yesterday’s money, and digital payments the gleaming future.  
**Chinese:** 所有这些电子转账从一个账户到另一个账户曾经看起来像是现代的化身——不管街头艺人、乞丐和逃税者的抗议。政客们长期推动更多数字支付，以帮助消灭未申报收入并打击洗钱。希腊强制企业，包括餐厅和出租车，接受数字支付并开具收据（尽管酒馆的刷卡机在账单到来时可能方便地失灵）。欧盟已规定现金使用门槛，要求国家立法禁止使用钞票进行大额商业支付。2019年，欧洲中央银行甚至停止发行新的500欧元（584美元）钞票。（这种钞票如此罕见，并被怀疑用于资助可疑活动，以至于被称为“本·拉登”。）在欧洲人眼中，现金是昨天的钱，数字支付是闪亮的未来。

### Paragraph 5
**English:** Some protested, notably those on the populist right. They have long denigrated digital payments as a sop to banks (which profit from each card swipe); cash, they say, is a form of “printed freedom”. But consumers have voted with their wallets. Across the euro area cash was used for 79% of in-person transactions in 2016, but just 52% in 2024 (and accounted for a smaller share of value, because cards are preferred for larger payments). Coffee shops realised they could do brisker business by having punters tap their bank cards instead of shuffling bits of metal. Particularly after covid-19, payments in coins and notes became so rare in many shops as to no longer be worth it. An ever-growing number put out “no cash” signs: across Europe, 12% of all businesses flatly refused cash in 2024, up from 4% just three years earlier. In some countries the figure is higher. Over one in three cinemas in the Netherlands no longer accept notes and coins. Cash looked headed for a doom loop: fewer people were taking out euros because fewer shops accepted them, because fewer people use them, and so on.  
**Chinese:** 一些人抗议，特别是民粹右翼。他们长期贬低数字支付是为银行的讨好（银行从每一次刷卡中获利）；他们说，现金是一种“印刷的自由”。但消费者用他们的钱包投票。在欧元区，现金在2016年用于79%的面对面交易，但2024年仅为52%（并且占价值的比例更小，因为卡片更适合大额支付）。咖啡店意识到，通过让顾客轻触银行卡而不是翻找金属硬币，他们可以做更快的生意。特别是在新冠疫情后，许多商店的硬币和纸币支付变得如此罕见，以至于不再值得。越来越多的商家挂出“无现金”标志：全欧洲，2024年12%的企业断然拒绝现金，比仅仅三年前的4%上升。在一些国家，这个数字更高。荷兰超过三分之一的电影院不再接受纸币和硬币。现金看起来正走向一个厄运循环：更少的人取出欧元，因为更少的商店接受它们，因为更少的人使用它们，等等。

### Paragraph 6
**English:** Yet authorities now think electronic money may be too much of a good thing. They would like to see, if not a dash back to cash, then at least a way to ensure it continues as a ubiquitous means of payment. In 2021 a ruling from the top EU court affirmed that paper money should in principle be accepted. To remove all remaining doubt, in December ministers from the EU’s 27 member states reiterated their desire to ban businesses from refusing notes and coins. As part of a forthcoming law, shops and restaurants will still be able to indicate they prefer digital payments, but will need also to accept old-fashioned cash.  
**Chinese:** 然而，当局现在认为电子货币可能好事过头了。他们希望看到，如果不是回归现金，至少有一种方式确保它继续作为无处不在的支付手段。2021年，欧盟最高法院的一项裁决确认纸币原则上应该被接受。为了消除所有剩余疑虑，12月，欧盟27个成员国的部长们重申他们希望禁止企业拒绝纸币和硬币。作为即将出台的法律的一部分，商店和餐厅仍然可以表示他们更喜欢数字支付，但也需要接受老式的现金。

### Paragraph 7
**English:** Why the seeming backtrack? One concern is that a sizeable minority are still digitally averse. Newfangled apps and PIN-locked cards are great for young and connected types, and tolerable for the middle-aged and mildly hapless. But for the elderly the experience of juggling bank cards and apps can be frustrating. Some poor people struggle to open bank accounts at all.  
**Chinese:** 为什么看似倒退？一个担忧是相当多的少数人仍然对数字化厌恶。新奇的应用和PIN锁定的卡片对年轻和联网类型的人来说很棒，对中年和轻度无助的人来说是可以容忍的。但对老年人来说， juggling 银行卡和应用的经历可能令人沮丧。有些穷人根本难以开设银行账户。

### Paragraph 8
**English:** A more recent misgiving centres on the resilience of payment systems. Convenient as they are when things work well, getting money to move around ethereally requires electricity and a data connection. Spaniards facing nationwide power cuts last spring found themselves unable to buy food and other necessities. And what of threats from foreign adversaries? Some fret that too much digital payment leaves Europe dependent on the likes of Visa and MasterCard, American firms with unpredictable political masters. (The ECB is mulling a “digital euro” in response, though that will take years.) In the Baltics and Nordics, where angst focuses on Russian sabotage, digital payments systems now work for a time even when power is cut. But nothing beats cash when it comes to resilience. Swedes have long been advised to store enough in notes and coins to get through a week, a move the EU now recommends. After years of tapping and swiping to pay, Europe is discovering that some change is worth keeping.  
**Chinese:** 一个更近期的疑虑集中在支付系统的韧性上。当事情运转良好时它们很方便，但让钱 ethereal 地移动需要电力和数据连接。去年春天面临全国停电的西班牙人发现自己无法购买食物和其他必需品。而且外国对手的威胁呢？有些人担心太多的数字支付让欧洲依赖于Visa和MasterCard这样的美国公司，这些公司有不可预测的政治主人。（欧洲央行正在考虑“数字欧元”作为回应，尽管那将需要几年。）在波罗的海和北欧国家，那里的焦虑集中在俄罗斯破坏上，数字支付系统现在即使在断电时也能工作一段时间。但在韧性方面，没有什么能胜过现金。瑞典人长期被建议储存足够的纸币和硬币来度过一周，这是欧盟现在推荐的举措。经过多年的轻触和刷卡支付，欧洲正在发现一些零钱值得保留。
