# Trump’s Board of Peace is a distraction from the real work in Gaza

America’s president has unusual power to impose peace; he must continue to use it

Donald Trump claims to have ended eight “unendable” wars in his second term. In some cases he exaggerates his role; in others the fighting rages on. In Gaza, though, he really did impose a ceasefire, force Israel to withdraw from populated areas and compel Hamas to release its hostages.

However, this was just the first phase of a 20-point peace plan. In the three months since the ceasefire went into effect, only one element of the second phase has been implemented. A Palestinian National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (ncag) was appointed on January 14th. Since Israel has not allowed its 15 members to enter the devastated territory, let alone govern it, it is unclear that it has much power.

The obstacles to peace in Gaza are steep. Hamas is in no rush to give up what remains of its arsenal or relinquish its grip on much of Gaza. Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, will face voters this year and is loth to withdraw further. Israel still controls more than half the territory and occasionally conducts deadly strikes there. It is reluctant to pull back troops or relinquish any control while Hamas still has power.

Mr Trump pushed through the first phase by making clear demands of both sides. He followed this with pressure on Mr Netanyahu, applied personally, and on Hamas through its patrons, Qatar and Turkey. When either side hesitated, Mr Trump simply declared that an agreement had been reached, daring them to contradict him. His bullying style of dealmaking succeeded where two years of diplomacy had failed. Since then, however, his attention has drifted.

The recent announcement of three new peacemaking bodies is unlikely to get the process back on track. The executive board Mr Trump has appointed to oversee Gaza is dominated by people more adept at scouting for business than ending humanitarian crises. It does not include a single Palestinian. Over them all will sit a “Board of Peace”, a private club of world leaders. Membership will cost $1bn. The veto-wielding chairman, perhaps for life, is Mr Trump.

The board’s charter laments that “too many approaches to peace-building foster perpetual dependency and institutionalise crisis.” This is undoubtedly true of much conventional diplomacy. If the board is the “nimble and effective international peace-building body” the charter envisages, the world should cheer. But could a forum tailored to one man’s unquenchable ego provide a useful alternative to the UN?

More likely, it will distract further from the plight of Gaza. That territory remains divided between an Israeli-occupied wasteland and a Hamas fief. This is a recipe for prolonged misery for 2m Gazans, many of whom remain homeless and without much food or medical care. These are the sort of conditions in which a new war might break out. Mr Trump alone has the power to force Mr Netanyahu and Hamas’s chiefs to take the next steps. His plan for Gaza won widespread international backing. He should focus on that.

To alleviate the suffering of Gazans and prevent that return to war, the rest of phase two should be implemented—and urgently. The ncag should be allowed into Gaza and given the resources it needs to start preparing for reconstruction. An international peacekeeping force should be assembled and deployed. A verifiable process of disarming Hamas’s fighters must begin. And Israel must withdraw its troops from Gaza’s farmland as a prelude to a full withdrawal. Israel should allow much more aid to enter Gaza. The strip should be flooded with food, medicine and building materials.

Even with Mr Trump’s talent for strong-arming, none of this will be easy to bring about. But paying attention to Gaza is the first task. Success there would do more than anything else to burnish the president’s peacemaking credentials. ■

# Trump’s Board of Peace is a distraction from the real work in Gaza  
# 特朗普的和平委员会是对加沙真正工作的干扰  

**America’s president has unusual power to impose peace; he must continue to use it**  
**美国的总统有非凡权力强加和平；他必须继续使用它**

| Donald Trump claims to have ended eight “**unendable**” wars in his second term. In some cases he exaggerates his role; in others the fighting **rages** on. In Gaza, though, he really did **impose** a ceasefire, force Israel to withdraw from populated areas and **compel** Hamas to release its hostages. | 唐纳德·特朗普声称在他第二任期结束了八场“**无法结束**”的战争。在一些情况下他夸大了他的作用；在其他情况下战斗**激烈**继续。在加沙，然而，他确实**强加**了停火，迫使以色列从人口密集区撤军，并**强迫**哈马斯释放其人质。 |

| However, this was just the first phase of a 20-point peace plan. In the three months since the ceasefire went into effect, only one element of the second phase has been implemented.

Since Israel has not allowed its 15 members to enter the **devastated** territory, let alone govern it, it is unclear that it has much power. | 然而，这只是20点和平计划的第一阶段。自停火生效以来的三个月，只有第二阶段的一个元素被实施。巴勒斯坦加沙管理国家委员会（**ncag**）于1月14日被任命。由于以色列不允许其15名成员进入**被摧毁**的领土，更不用说治理它，不清楚它有多少权力。 |

| English | Chinese |
|---------|---------|
| The obstacles to peace in Gaza are **steep**. Hamas is in no rush to give up what remains of its arsenal or **relinquish** its grip on much of Gaza. Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, will face voters this year and is **loth** to withdraw further. Israel still controls more than half the territory and occasionally conducts deadly strikes there. It is reluctant to pull back troops or **relinquish** any control while Hamas still has power. | 加沙和平的障碍是**陡峭**的。哈马斯不急于放弃其剩余军火库或**放弃**对加沙大部分地区的控制。本雅明·内塔尼亚胡，以色列总理，今年将面对选民，不愿进一步撤军。以色列仍控制超过一半领土，并偶尔在那里进行致命打击。它不愿撤军或**放弃**任何控制，而哈马斯仍有权力。 |

His **bullying** style of dealmaking succeeded where two years of diplomacy had failed. Since then, however, his attention has **drifted**. | 特朗普先生通过对双方提出明确要求推动了第一阶段。他随后亲自施压内塔尼亚胡先生，并通过哈马斯的赞助者卡塔尔和土耳其施压哈马斯。当任何一方犹豫时，特朗普先生简单地宣布已达成协议，敢于让他们反驳。他**霸凌**式的交易风格在两年外交失败的地方成功了。然而，自那时起，他的注意力已**漂移**。 |
