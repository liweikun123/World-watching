# What the collapse of Iran’s regime would mean

Thousands have died and America has threatened to strike back against the horror there

WHEN PROTESTERS took to the bazaars and streets of Iran, the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, met them with bullets. After two weeks of chants of “death to the dictator”, militiamen allied with the Revolutionary Guards and toting automatic rifles rode in on swarms of motorbikes. With snipers, they shot their fellow citizens, aiming at their faces and genitals. Morgues are overflowing. Bodies in bags are stacked on bloodied pavements. Several thousand may be dead. Thousands of the wounded have been arrested, some dragged from hospital beds to prison cells and an uncertain fate.

This ought to be the moment that ends the theocrats’ 47 years in power. Iranians deserve to live in a democratic and prosperous country, not least because of their bravery. The world would benefit if Iran was turned from being a nuclear threat and an exporter of violence across the Middle East to a tolerant, stable trading power. But protests alone don’t end tyranny. What would an American strike contemplated by President Donald Trump do to bring about the mullahs’ downfall? And if the regime were to topple, what might follow?

Iran’s rulers are merciless because of their weakness. They have nowhere to turn and nothing to offer their people but violence. At home, Iran’s citizens must endure a shrinking economy, rapidly rising food prices, joblessness and worsening poverty. Abroad, the regime has been humiliated, as its proxy forces in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza were battered or destroyed, mostly by Israel, since 2023. Last year’s 12-day war showed that the regime could not even protect its own commanders and nuclear sites. After crushing protests in previous years Mr Khamenei sometimes offered concessions, such as relaxing the dress code for women. This month his government proposed a general stipend worth $7 a month, hoping to buy off public anger. That was met with derision.

The days ahead are fraught with uncertainty and danger. The protesters have withdrawn from the streets, though for how long nobody can say. The bleakest outcome would be that the regime remains in power, bonded by blood, condemning Iranians to a stagnant, enduring oppression. Bad, too, would be a collapse of Iran into worse violence. The break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and civil war in Syria offer stark lessons in how hard it is to end decades of repression without provoking mass bloodshed. Kurdish, Azeri, Baluchi or other separatists could rise up and Iran could descend into chaos. Add the presence of enriched uranium, nuclear scientists and religious extremists, and the risks are grave. Fear of what comes next may explain why some inside Iran have so far failed to join the protests.

In between are scenarios in which the regime fragments. Perhaps the Revolutionary Guards will oust the supreme leader. Or a faction of guards may seize power in the name of the people, and seek legitimacy by holding rival factions to account for the recent killings. If so, they could be helped by the regular army, which so far has stood aside. Either way, the new men in charge could seek to strike a deal in which America lifted sanctions in exchange for strict limits on Iran’s nuclear programme and ballistic missiles.

America could attempt to land a blow against a regime that has been a running sore in Washington for over four decades. This week Mr Trump first threatened “very strong” action against Tehran, while calling for more protests, and then appeared to retreat—whether as a ruse or out of caution is unclear. If he attacks, his preferred option would surely be a limited strike. Perhaps he could aim for a political decapitation, somewhat like the one he recently oversaw in Venezuela, whereby the detested Mr Khamenei is deposed or killed. Or America could drop bombs and missiles on selected sites inside Iran, perhaps targeting structures associated with the Revolutionary Guards.

At less risk, America could help end the communications blackout imposed by the regime, by smuggling Starlink kits into Iran. One sign this matters is that security forces are hunting for those already in the country. The White House is also giving tacit support to an exiled opposition figure, Reza Pahlavi, the former crown prince, who fled from Iran when the shah was toppled in 1979. From a safe distance in Maryland he, too, has been urging protesters to rise up to bring democracy. In the absence of organised opposition inside Iran, perhaps the country could restore some form of monarchy, (see our interview with Mr Pahlavi).

However, just to run through the options shows how hard it will be for American action to succeed. If Mr Trump orders strikes, Iran is armed with a formidable battery of short- and long-range missiles that could hit back across the Middle East, leading to an unpredictable escalation—which is why countries there are warning against an American attack. A decapitation from the air would require exquisite intelligence against an adversary who is forewarned. Even with the ayatollah gone, a Caracas-style deal with the Revolutionary Guards is unlikely to create lasting stability, because grieving Iranians will yearn for vengeance against generals with so much fresh blood on their hands.

The stakes are extraordinarily high. With Mr Trump in office, old certainties in geopolitics are melting away. His concern will never be to respect international law, nor to foster a club of liberal democracies. But, even as Iran is abandoned by its allies, China and Russia, he is readier than any recent American president to bring about big changes if he believes they will enhance America’s influence and his own prestige. Each intervention is a test of what sort of world that will create.

Once every popular uprising seemed to herald the birth of a new democracy. Alas, after the failures of the Arab spring, it is no longer easy to imagine that Iran’s path could be so simple. The hope nonetheless is that, in time, the collapse of the regime will favour Iran’s courageous people, who have proved once again that they are their country’s greatest blessing. ■

# What the collapse of Iran’s regime would mean

## Original English Text + Chinese Translation

### Title (标题)
**English:** What the collapse of Iran’s regime would mean  
**Chinese:** 伊朗政权崩溃将意味着什么

### Subtitle (副标题)
**English:** Thousands have died and America has threatened to strike back against the horror there  
**Chinese:** 数千人死亡，美国威胁对那里的恐怖进行反击

### Paragraph 1
**English:** WHEN PROTESTERS took to the bazaars and streets of Iran, the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, met them with bullets. After two weeks of chants of “death to the dictator”, militiamen allied with the Revolutionary Guards and toting automatic rifles rode in on swarms of motorbikes. With snipers, they shot their fellow citizens, aiming at their faces and genitals. Morgues are overflowing. Bodies in bags are stacked on bloodied pavements. Several thousand may be dead. Thousands of the wounded have been arrested, some dragged from hospital beds to prison cells and an uncertain fate.  
**Chinese:** 当抗议者走上伊朗的集市和街道时，最高领袖阿里·哈梅内伊用子弹迎接他们。经过两周的“独裁者去死”口号后，与革命卫队结盟的民兵携带自动步枪，骑着成群的摩托车涌入。用狙击手，他们射击自己的同胞，瞄准他们的脸部和生殖器。太平间人满为患。装在袋子里的尸体堆放在血迹斑斑的人行道上。可能有数千人死亡。数千伤者已被逮捕，有些人从医院床上被拖到监狱牢房，面临不确定的命运。

### Paragraph 2
**English:** This ought to be the moment that ends the theocrats’ 47 years in power. Iranians deserve to live in a democratic and prosperous country, not least because of their bravery. The world would benefit if Iran was turned from being a nuclear threat and an exporter of violence across the Middle East to a tolerant, stable trading power. But protests alone don’t end tyranny. What would an American strike contemplated by President Donald Trump do to bring about the mullahs’ downfall? And if the regime were to topple, what might follow?  
**Chinese:** 这应该是结束神权统治者47年权力的时刻。伊朗人理应生活在一个民主和繁荣的国家，尤其是因为他们的勇敢。如果伊朗从一个核威胁和中东暴力出口国转变为一个宽容、稳定的贸易大国，世界将受益。但抗议本身并不能结束暴政。唐纳德·特朗普总统考虑的美国打击将如何促成毛拉们的倒台？如果政权倒台，会发生什么？

### Paragraph 3
**English:** Iran’s rulers are merciless because of their weakness. They have nowhere to turn and nothing to offer their people but violence. At home, Iran’s citizens must endure a shrinking economy, rapidly rising food prices, joblessness and worsening poverty. Abroad, the regime has been humiliated, as its proxy forces in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza were battered or destroyed, mostly by Israel, since 2023. Last year’s 12-day war showed that the regime could not even protect its own commanders and nuclear sites. After crushing protests in previous years Mr Khamenei sometimes offered concessions, such as relaxing the dress code for women. This month his government proposed a general stipend worth $7 a month, hoping to buy off public anger. That was met with derision.  
**Chinese:** 伊朗的统治者无情是因为他们的弱点。他们无处可去，除了暴力，什么也无法提供给人民。在国内，伊朗公民必须忍受收缩的经济、迅速上涨的食品价格、失业和日益恶化的贫困。在国外，该政权已被羞辱，因为其在黎巴嫩、叙利亚和加沙的代理力量自2023年以来大多被以色列重创或摧毁。去年的12天战争显示，该政权甚至无法保护自己的指挥官和核设施。在以往年份镇压抗议后，哈梅内伊先生有时提供让步，如放松女性的着装规定。本月，他的政府提出每月价值7美元的通用津贴，希望收买公众愤怒。这遭到了嘲笑。

### Paragraph 4
**English:** The days ahead are fraught with uncertainty and danger. The protesters have withdrawn from the streets, though for how long nobody can say. The bleakest outcome would be that the regime remains in power, bonded by blood, condemning Iranians to a stagnant, enduring oppression. Bad, too, would be a collapse of Iran into worse violence. The break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and civil war in Syria offer stark lessons in how hard it is to end decades of repression without provoking mass bloodshed. Kurdish, Azeri, Baluchi or other separatists could rise up and Iran could descend into chaos. Add the presence of enriched uranium, nuclear scientists and religious extremists, and the risks are grave. Fear of what comes next may explain why some inside Iran have so far failed to join the protests.  
**Chinese:** 前方的日子充满不确定性和危险。抗议者已从街道上撤退，尽管没人能说会持续多久。最阴郁的结果是该政权继续掌权，通过鲜血维系，将伊朗人判处停滞、持久的压迫。坏的还有伊朗崩溃成更严重的暴力。1990年代南斯拉夫的解体、2003年入侵伊拉克和叙利亚内战提供了严峻教训，显示结束几十年的镇压而不引发大规模流血是多么困难。库尔德人、阿塞拜疆人、俾路支人或其他分离主义者可能起义，伊朗可能陷入混乱。加上浓缩铀、核科学家和宗教极端分子的存在，风险是严重的。对接下来会发生什么的恐惧可能解释为什么伊朗内部的一些人迄今未能加入抗议。

### Paragraph 5
**English:** In between are scenarios in which the regime fragments. Perhaps the Revolutionary Guards will oust the supreme leader. Or a faction of guards may seize power in the name of the people, and seek legitimacy by holding rival factions to account for the recent killings. If so, they could be helped by the regular army, which so far has stood aside. Either way, the new men in charge could seek to strike a deal in which America lifted sanctions in exchange for strict limits on Iran’s nuclear programme and ballistic missiles.  
**Chinese:** 中间是政权碎片化的情景。也许革命卫队将驱逐最高领袖。或者卫队的一个派系以人民的名义夺取权力，并通过追究敌对派系最近杀戮的责任来寻求合法性。如果是这样，他们可能得到迄今旁观的正规军的帮助。无论哪种方式，新掌权者可能寻求达成协议，其中美国解除制裁，以换取对伊朗核计划和弹道导弹的严格限制。

### Paragraph 6
**English:** America could attempt to land a blow against a regime that has been a running sore in Washington for over four decades. This week Mr Trump first threatened “very strong” action against Tehran, while calling for more protests, and then appeared to retreat—whether as a ruse or out of caution is unclear. If he attacks, his preferred option would surely be a limited strike. Perhaps he could aim for a political decapitation, somewhat like the one he recently oversaw in Venezuela, whereby the detested Mr Khamenei is deposed or killed. Or America could drop bombs and missiles on selected sites inside Iran, perhaps targeting structures associated with the Revolutionary Guards.  
**Chinese:** 美国可能尝试对这个在华盛顿持续四十多年的溃疡政权进行打击。本周，特朗普先生首先威胁对德黑兰采取“非常强硬”的行动，同时呼吁更多抗议，然后似乎退缩——是作为诡计还是出于谨慎尚不清楚。如果他攻击，他首选的选项肯定是有限打击。也许他可以瞄准政治斩首，有点像他最近在委内瑞拉监督的那样，从而废黜或杀死令人厌恶的哈梅内伊先生。或者美国可以在伊朗境内选定地点投放炸弹和导弹，或许针对与革命卫队相关的结构。

### Paragraph 7
**English:** At less risk, America could help end the communications blackout imposed by the regime, by smuggling Starlink kits into Iran. One sign this matters is that security forces are hunting for those already in the country. The White House is also giving tacit support to an exiled opposition figure, Reza Pahlavi, the former crown prince, who fled from Iran when the shah was toppled in 1979. From a safe distance in Maryland he, too, has been urging protesters to rise up to bring democracy. In the absence of organised opposition inside Iran, perhaps the country could restore some form of monarchy, (see our interview with Mr Pahlavi).  
**Chinese:** 以较小的风险，美国可以通过走私Starlink套件进入伊朗来帮助结束政权施加的通讯 blackout。一个迹象是安全部队正在猎捕那些已经在该国的套件。白宫也在默许支持一位流亡反对派人物，前王储雷扎·巴列维，他于1979年国王被推翻时逃离伊朗。从马里兰的安全距离，他也在敦促抗议者起义带来民主。在伊朗内部缺乏有组织的反对派的情况下，或许该国可以恢复某种形式的君主制，（见我们对巴列维先生的采访）。

### Paragraph 8
**English:** However, just to run through the options shows how hard it will be for American action to succeed. If Mr Trump orders strikes, Iran is armed with a formidable battery of short- and long-range missiles that could hit back across the Middle East, leading to an unpredictable escalation—which is why countries there are warning against an American attack. A decapitation from the air would require exquisite intelligence against an adversary who is forewarned. Even with the ayatollah gone, a Caracas-style deal with the Revolutionary Guards is unlikely to create lasting stability, because grieving Iranians will yearn for vengeance against generals with so much fresh blood on their hands.  
**Chinese:** 然而，只是浏览选项就显示美国行动成功将是多么困难。如果特朗普先生下令打击，伊朗装备有强大的短程和远程导弹电池，可以在中东反击，导致不可预测的升级——这就是那里国家警告反对美国攻击的原因。从空中进行斩首将需要对一个被预先警告的对手的精湛情报。即使阿亚图拉消失，与革命卫队的加拉加斯式协议也不太可能创造持久稳定，因为悲伤的伊朗人将渴望对那些手上沾满新鲜鲜血的将军们复仇。

### Paragraph 9
**English:** The stakes are extraordinarily high. With Mr Trump in office, old certainties in geopolitics are melting away. His concern will never be to respect international law, nor to foster a club of liberal democracies. But, even as Iran is abandoned by its allies, China and Russia, he is readier than any recent American president to bring about big changes if he believes they will enhance America’s influence and his own prestige. Each intervention is a test of what sort of world that will create.  
**Chinese:** 赌注异常高。随着特朗普先生上台，地缘政治中的旧确定性正在融化。他的关注永远不会是尊重国际法，也不会是培养一个自由民主俱乐部。但是，即使伊朗被其盟友中国和俄罗斯抛弃，如果他相信这将提升美国的影响力和他自己的威望，他比任何最近的美国总统都更准备带来重大变化。每一次干预都是对将创造何种世界的考验。

### Paragraph 10
**English:** Once every popular uprising seemed to herald the birth of a new democracy. Alas, after the failures of the Arab spring, it is no longer easy to imagine that Iran’s path could be so simple. The hope nonetheless is that, in time, the collapse of the regime will favour Iran’s courageous people, who have proved once again that they are their country’s greatest blessing. ■  
**Chinese:** 曾经每一次民众起义似乎都预示着一个新民主的诞生。唉，在阿拉伯之春的失败后，不再容易想象伊朗的道路会如此简单。尽管如此，希望是，随着时间的推移，政权的崩溃将有利于伊朗勇敢的人民，他们再次证明他们是他们国家最大的祝福。■
