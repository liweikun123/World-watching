# France is paralysed, and everyone is to blame

The budgetary impasse is just one symptom of collective political uselessness

Over the past five years Europe’s once-profligate south has sorted out its public finances. Italy, Greece and Spain have brought down their budget deficits to levels commensurate with EU rules. The exception is France, which for three years has run a huge deficit of over 5% of GDP. You might think that being economically upstaged by countries that it helped rescue during the euro-zone crisis would focus political minds. Instead France has failed even to pass a budget for 2026. It now faces the latest in a series of parliamentary battles to adopt one by the end of the month.

The budgetary impasse is one symptom of a deeper malady: a severe case of collective political uselessness. Emmanuel Macron is entering the last 15 months of his presidency. He can still act internationally but is a lame duck at home, viewed favourably by less than 20% of the French. His centrist coalition holds 161 of the 577 seats in the splintered National Assembly, making it virtually impossible to get anything done. The populist right and left delight in Mr Macron’s paralysis. It is a dismal spectacle at a critical time, and everyone shares some of the blame.

France’s descent into ungovernability began in 2023, when the opposition and the unions whipped up anger over Mr Macron’s sensible pension reform, which raised the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64. With the populist-left Unsubmissive France (LFI) party and the populist-right National Rally (RN) egging them on, protesters took to the streets to rail against demographic reality. After the RN won the European Parliament elections in 2024, Mr Macron foolishly called early legislative elections. Those left him with a smaller centrist minority. A new prime minister, Michel Barnier, lasted barely three months before the RN and LFI teamed up to kick him out.

Mr Barnier’s successor, François Bayrou, gamely proposed a budget last July that would have trimmed the deficit to 4.6% of GDP. Parliament balked and toppled him in September. The next prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, managed to pass part of the budget by caving in to the Socialists’ demand to freeze the pension reform. To get the rest through, he swallowed a long list of new or increased taxes from the Socialists, the tiny Greens and even the RN. But it was not enough. In December the government rolled over the 2025 budget into 2026.

Every major actor in French politics should be ashamed. The extremes seem happy to let France twist in the wind. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the LFI’s leader, has his feet planted firmly on the barricades. Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, who lead the RN, hope Mr Macron goes down in flames so they can swoop to victory at the presidential election in 2027. The Socialists and Greens have no vision for solving France’s budget crisis beyond raising taxes. The Republicans, supposedly fiscal conservatives, allowed a suspension of the pension reform that will cost €100m ($117m) in 2026 alone.

Perhaps nobody could have managed this fractious crew. But Mr Macron’s haughty, distant approach has not helped. Finally, one should not spare from blame the voters, who failed to appreciate Mr Macron’s successful economic policies, refuse to accept that the welfare system needs reform and keep voting for the most irresponsible politicians.

This is a bad time for France to be in such a mess. Like the rest of Europe, it is staring down Vladimir Putin while dodging blows from Donald Trump. It needs to find money for a lot more defence spending and to revive an economy menaced by Chinese competition. Yet its debt stock (117% of GDP) is too high already, so any extra spending must be matched by cuts or higher taxes—and its taxes are already the highest in the G7.

France cannot afford to be stuck. If Mr Lecornu cannot fix the budget by the end of January, he must go, and fresh elections should be called. Though the centrists might improve their position, an RN-led government seems more likely. Being obliged to take responsibility for governing might force the wrecking populists to grow up. But it may fall to the markets, rather than voters, to chastise France’s useless politicians. ■

# France is paralysed, and everyone is to blame

## Original English Text + Chinese Translation

### Title (标题)
**English:** France is paralysed, and everyone is to blame  
**Chinese:** 法国陷入瘫痪，每个人都有责任

### Subtitle (副标题)
**English:** The budgetary impasse is just one symptom of collective political uselessness  
**Chinese:** 预算僵局只是集体政治无用性的一个症状

### Paragraph 1
**English:** Over the past five years Europe’s once-profligate south has sorted out its public finances. Italy, Greece and Spain have brought down their budget deficits to levels commensurate with EU rules. The exception is France, which for three years has run a huge deficit of over 5% of GDP. You might think that being economically upstaged by countries that it helped rescue during the euro-zone crisis would focus political minds. Instead France has failed even to pass a budget for 2026. It now faces the latest in a series of parliamentary battles to adopt one by the end of the month.  
**Chinese:** 在过去五年中，欧洲曾经挥霍无度的南部已经整理了其公共财政。意大利、希腊和西班牙已将预算赤字降低到与欧盟规则相称的水平。例外是法国，它在三年中运行了超过GDP 5%的巨大赤字。你可能认为，被它在欧元区危机期间帮助救援的国家在经济上抢了风头，会集中政治注意力。相反，法国甚至未能通过2026年的预算。它现在面临一系列议会斗争中的最新一场，以在本月底通过一份预算。

### Paragraph 2
**English:** The budgetary impasse is one symptom of a deeper malady: a severe case of collective political uselessness. Emmanuel Macron is entering the last 15 months of his presidency. He can still act internationally but is a lame duck at home, viewed favourably by less than 20% of the French. His centrist coalition holds 161 of the 577 seats in the splintered National Assembly, making it virtually impossible to get anything done. The populist right and left delight in Mr Macron’s paralysis. It is a dismal spectacle at a critical time, and everyone shares some of the blame.  
**Chinese:** 预算僵局是一个更深层疾病的症状：集体政治无用性的严重病例。埃马纽埃尔·马克龙正在进入其总统任期的最后15个月。他仍然可以在国际上行动，但在国内是跛脚鸭，只有不到20%的法国人看好他。他的中间派联盟在分裂的国民议会中持有577个席位中的161个，这使得几乎不可能完成任何事。民粹右翼和左翼乐于马克龙先生的瘫痪。这是一个关键时刻的凄凉景象，每个人都分担一些责任。

### Paragraph 3
**English:** France’s descent into ungovernability began in 2023, when the opposition and the unions whipped up anger over Mr Macron’s sensible pension reform, which raised the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64. With the populist-left Unsubmissive France (LFI) party and the populist-right National Rally (RN) egging them on, protesters took to the streets to rail against demographic reality. After the RN won the European Parliament elections in 2024, Mr Macron foolishly called early legislative elections. Those left him with a smaller centrist minority. A new prime minister, Michel Barnier, lasted barely three months before the RN and LFI teamed up to kick him out.  
**Chinese:** 法国陷入无法治理的状态始于2023年，当时反对派和工会煽动了对马克龙先生合理养老金改革的愤怒，该改革将最低退休年龄从62岁提高到64岁。在民粹左翼的不屈法国（LFI）党和民粹右翼的国民联盟（RN）怂恿下，抗议者走上街头谴责人口现实。在RN赢得2024年欧洲议会选举后，马克龙先生愚蠢地提前举行立法选举。这些选举让他只剩下一个更小的中间派少数派。新总理米歇尔·巴尼耶勉强维持了三个月，就在RN和LFI联手将他赶下台之前。

### Paragraph 4
**English:** Mr Barnier’s successor, François Bayrou, gamely proposed a budget last July that would have trimmed the deficit to 4.6% of GDP. Parliament balked and toppled him in September. The next prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, managed to pass part of the budget by caving in to the Socialists’ demand to freeze the pension reform. To get the rest through, he swallowed a long list of new or increased taxes from the Socialists, the tiny Greens and even the RN. But it was not enough. In December the government rolled over the 2025 budget into 2026.  
**Chinese:** 巴尼耶的继任者弗朗索瓦·贝鲁勇敢地在去年7月提出了一份预算，将赤字削减到GDP的4.6%。议会犹豫不决，并在9月推翻了他。下一任总理塞巴斯蒂安·勒科尔努通过屈从于社会党冻结养老金改革的要求，设法通过了部分预算。为了通过其余部分，他吞下了社会党、微小的绿党和甚至RN的一长串新税或增税。但这还不够。12月，政府将2025年的预算延续到2026年。

### Paragraph 5
**English:** Every major actor in French politics should be ashamed. The extremes seem happy to let France twist in the wind. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the LFI’s leader, has his feet planted firmly on the barricades. Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, who lead the RN, hope Mr Macron goes down in flames so they can swoop to victory at the presidential election in 2027. The Socialists and Greens have no vision for solving France’s budget crisis beyond raising taxes. The Republicans, supposedly fiscal conservatives, allowed a suspension of the pension reform that will cost €100m ($117m) in 2026 alone.  
**Chinese:** 法国政治中的每个主要参与者都应该感到羞耻。极端分子似乎乐于让法国在风中扭转。让-吕克·梅朗雄，LFI的领导人，他的脚牢牢地站在街垒上。领导RN的马琳·勒庞和乔丹·巴德拉希望马克龙先生在火焰中倒下，以便他们在2027年总统选举中突袭胜利。社会党和绿党除了提高税收之外，对解决法国预算危机没有愿景。共和党，据说是财政保守派，允许暂停养老金改革，这仅在2026年就将花费1亿欧元（1.17亿美元）。

### Paragraph 6
**English:** Perhaps nobody could have managed this fractious crew. But Mr Macron’s haughty, distant approach has not helped. Finally, one should not spare from blame the voters, who failed to appreciate Mr Macron’s successful economic policies, refuse to accept that the welfare system needs reform and keep voting for the most irresponsible politicians.  
**Chinese:** 也许没有人能管理这个易怒的团体。但马克龙先生傲慢、疏远的做法并没有帮助。最后，不应该免除选民的责任，他们未能欣赏马克龙先生成功的经济政策，拒绝接受福利系统需要改革，并继续投票给最不负责任的政客。

### Paragraph 7
**English:** This is a bad time for France to be in such a mess. Like the rest of Europe, it is staring down Vladimir Putin while dodging blows from Donald Trump. It needs to find money for a lot more defence spending and to revive an economy menaced by Chinese competition. Yet its debt stock (117% of GDP) is too high already, so any extra spending must be matched by cuts or higher taxes—and its taxes are already the highest in the G7.  
**Chinese:** 这对法国来说是一个糟糕的时机，陷入这样的混乱。像欧洲其他国家一样，它正盯着弗拉基米尔·普京，同时躲避唐纳德·特朗普的打击。它需要找到资金用于更多的国防开支，并复兴一个受到中国竞争威胁的经济。然而，其债务存量（GDP的117%）已经太高，因此任何额外开支必须通过削减或更高的税收来匹配——而它的税收已经是G7中最高的。

### Paragraph 8
**English:** France cannot afford to be stuck. If Mr Lecornu cannot fix the budget by the end of January, he must go, and fresh elections should be called. Though the centrists might improve their position, an RN-led government seems more likely. Being obliged to take responsibility for governing might force the wrecking populists to grow up. But it may fall to the markets, rather than voters, to chastise France’s useless politicians. ■  
**Chinese:** 法国不能承受停滞不前。如果勒科尔努先生不能在1月底前修复预算，他必须下台，并应该举行新的选举。虽然中间派可能改善他们的位置，但一个由RN领导的政府似乎更有可能。被迫承担治理责任可能迫使破坏性的民粹主义者成熟。但可能由市场，而不是选民，来惩罚法国无用的政客。■
