# France is paralysed, and everyone is to blame

The budgetary impasse is just one symptom of collective political uselessness

Over the past five years Europe’s once-profligate south has sorted out its public finances. Italy, Greece and Spain have brought down their budget deficits to levels commensurate with EU rules. The exception is France, which for three years has run a huge deficit of over 5% of GDP. You might think that being economically upstaged by countries that it helped rescue during the euro-zone crisis would focus political minds. Instead France has failed even to pass a budget for 2026. It now faces the latest in a series of parliamentary battles to adopt one by the end of the month.

The budgetary impasse is one symptom of a deeper malady: a severe case of collective political uselessness. Emmanuel Macron is entering the last 15 months of his presidency. He can still act internationally but is a lame duck at home, viewed favourably by less than 20% of the French. His centrist coalition holds 161 of the 577 seats in the splintered National Assembly, making it virtually impossible to get anything done. The populist right and left delight in Mr Macron’s paralysis. It is a dismal spectacle at a critical time, and everyone shares some of the blame.

France’s descent into ungovernability began in 2023, when the opposition and the unions whipped up anger over Mr Macron’s sensible pension reform, which raised the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64. With the populist-left Unsubmissive France (LFI) party and the populist-right National Rally (RN) egging them on, protesters took to the streets to rail against demographic reality. After the RN won the European Parliament elections in 2024, Mr Macron foolishly called early legislative elections. Those left him with a smaller centrist minority. A new prime minister, Michel Barnier, lasted barely three months before the RN and LFI teamed up to kick him out.

Mr Barnier’s successor, François Bayrou, gamely proposed a budget last July that would have trimmed the deficit to 4.6% of GDP. Parliament balked and toppled him in September. The next prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, managed to pass part of the budget by caving in to the Socialists’ demand to freeze the pension reform. To get the rest through, he swallowed a long list of new or increased taxes from the Socialists, the tiny Greens and even the RN. But it was not enough. In December the government rolled over the 2025 budget into 2026.

Every major actor in French politics should be ashamed. The extremes seem happy to let France twist in the wind. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the LFI’s leader, has his feet planted firmly on the barricades. Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, who lead the RN, hope Mr Macron goes down in flames so they can swoop to victory at the presidential election in 2027. The Socialists and Greens have no vision for solving France’s budget crisis beyond raising taxes. The Republicans, supposedly fiscal conservatives, allowed a suspension of the pension reform that will cost €100m ($117m) in 2026 alone.

Perhaps nobody could have managed this fractious crew. But Mr Macron’s haughty, distant approach has not helped. Finally, one should not spare from blame the voters, who failed to appreciate Mr Macron’s successful economic policies, refuse to accept that the welfare system needs reform and keep voting for the most irresponsible politicians.

This is a bad time for France to be in such a mess. Like the rest of Europe, it is staring down Vladimir Putin while dodging blows from Donald Trump. It needs to find money for a lot more defence spending and to revive an economy menaced by Chinese competition. Yet its debt stock (117% of GDP) is too high already, so any extra spending must be matched by cuts or higher taxes—and its taxes are already the highest in the G7.

France cannot afford to be stuck. If Mr Lecornu cannot fix the budget by the end of January, he must go, and fresh elections should be called. Though the centrists might improve their position, an RN-led government seems more likely. Being obliged to take responsibility for governing might force the wrecking populists to grow up. But it may fall to the markets, rather than voters, to chastise France’s useless politicians. ■
