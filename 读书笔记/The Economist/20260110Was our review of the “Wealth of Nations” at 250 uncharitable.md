Your Christmas special review of Adam Smith and the “Wealth of Nations” at 250 seemed unseasonably uncharitable (“Adam Smith is misunderstood”, December 20th). Look hard enough and you can find antecedents of any revolutionary ideas: Newton’s physics, Copernicus’s solar system, Darwin’s evolution, Smith’s economics. The important thing is what these great thinkers made of them. Yes, Smith picked up observations from everywhere. But his genius was to show how those seemingly disparate observations meshed into a comprehensive, and surprisingly modern, understanding of economic life.

Certainly, he made mistakes, as pioneers do. Is the labour theory of value one of them? Smith mentions it only in the context of a primitive world without capital. It had been accepted wisdom for two millennia. But he clearly wasn’t happy with it, and the rest of the book goes on to explore the “higgling and bargaining of the market” as a better guide.

And who cares if Smith had never seen a pin factory? He made it a brilliant teaching to illustrate the thousandfold productivity gained from specialisation. Also, let’s not dismiss the “invisible hand” as a throwaway remark about a limited case. The whole of the “Wealth of Nations”, and his “Theory of Moral Sentiments” too, is an investigation of the complex relationship between individual actions and the overall social order, something Friedrich Hayek (it was he, not Smith, that was in Margaret Thatcher’s handbag) would go on to elaborate.

The “Wealth of Nations” deservedly had huge influence, especially in opening up world trade, and thereby boosting the welfare of humankind. So I shall wholeheartedly toast its 250th year, with a glass of claret (from France, of course, not Scotland).

Even the title, “Wealth of Nations”, was an important conceptual breakthrough. Before Smith, the standard belief was that a nation’s wealth consisted of gold and silver. After an admittedly lengthy lead-in, he seeks to demolish this notion. For example, he points out that the Spanish viewed national wealth in terms of gold and silver, while the Tatars of Genghis Khan saw national wealth in terms of cattle. Smith writes: “Of the two, the Tatar notion, perhaps, was the nearest to the truth.” Smith’s notion that the wealth of a nation should be measured by the consumption of its people, not by its trade surpluses nor the wealth of its government, remains incompletely learned.

Timothy TaylorSt Paul, Minnesota

The 250th anniversary of the “Wealth of Nations” is an excellent opportunity to reacquaint ourselves with what Smith had to say in that book and his other great work, the “Theory of Moral Sentiments” (1759). They should be viewed as complementary.

Smith argued that a healthy society should result from a vibrant economy. Yet we live in a world where the health of the economy and that of society have become disconnected. In many countries, the market economy no longer reflects the ideals of capitalism championed by Smith. Instead, capitalism has been hijacked by capitalists in pursuit of economic rents, sometimes supported by government favours. In many markets, the visible hand of government crowds out the invisible hand of entrepreneurship through the burden of excessive regulation.

Smith warned of the need to regulate banks to avoid systemic risks and of the principal-agent problem inherent in corporate governance. He also influenced the work of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, who in turn had an impact on Karl Marx. In “The Formation of the Economic Thought of Karl Marx”, Ernest Mandel noted that Hegel was “profoundly affected in his youth by economic studies, in particular by the work of Adam Smith.”

John Maynard Keynes said that as economic theorists strive for their unique contribution to the evolution of the science, none should compare themselves to Adam Smith. Hayek argued that Smith’s work surpasses all modern insights into the influences that shape human behaviour and society.

Many people will agree with your concern about British democracy caused by the rise of populist and extreme parties (”Britain’s slot-machine politics”, December 6th). It is a fallacy that this is caused by Britain’s representative voting system, (somewhat misleadingly termed “first past the post”). Almost all European countries use some form of proportional representation, and suffer at least as much from the rise of populism.

Those proposing proportional representation should be careful what they wish for. Candidates on party lists do not have to appeal to the voter, and being elected by the party machine, tend to be apparatchiks who are more extreme in their views than the average voter. The rewards offered to a plethora of small and single issue parties gives unwarranted power to extreme views.

The British system ensures that individual voters have a personal representative in the country’s government, something the party list system fails to do, and tends to reward parties with wide support. In 2011 British voters decisively rejected (by 68% to 32%) the Liberal Democrats’ more moderate Alternative Vote system.

Mark Leonard’s By Invitation urging Europe to get to grips with the MAGA challenge (December 13th) offered a few superficial solutions to stop the decline of centrism. It predictably avoided tackling the ever-growing elephant in the room. Under centrist governments, average real wages in much of the West have been stagnant for more than four decades. When the vast majority of the proceeds of economic growth go to a tiny, lucky group of individuals, the likes of whom the average citizen is unlikely to meet in their lifetime, the dwindling of enthusiasm for centrism is easy to understand.

Tom JansonBerlin

The attempt by Christian missionaries to use AI to translate the Bible into every one of the 7,000 languages spoken on the planet (“Climbing the Tower of Babel”, December 13th) calls to mind Arthur C. Clarke’s science-fiction short story, “The Nine Billion Names of God”. In the story Tibetan monks hire experts to write a computer program that spits out every possible permutation of a sequence of random letters. The monks believe that when all of the nine billion names of God have been discovered and recorded within the sacred books, history will come to an end. The story finishes ominously as the computer completes its task, and “Overhead, without any fuss, the stars were going out.”

Let’s hope the missionaries’ translation efforts don’t end with the same results.

Robert ChecchioDunellen, New Jersey

There is a theological complication in using large language models to translate the Bible. LLMs are notoriously unable to resist appending helpful suggestions to their output (ask ChatGPT for the capital of France and you’ll get “Paris”, followed by three creative options for planning your itinerary). Yet the Book of Revelation concludes with an explicit warning against adding to its text: “If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book.” The last verses of scripture forbid adding to scripture. The algorithm translating it has no idea how not to. This will not end well.

I read your piece on why many Asian megacities are miserable places (“Agglomerate this!”, December 13th) with increasingly narrow eyes. Particularly the claim that Jakarta is governed “as coherently as a clowder of cats”. First, a linguistic quibble. A clowder is a group of cats. So adding the species is redundant, though I recognise your impulse to tautology as a human habit.

More importantly, the comparison is unfair. We cats are not incoherent. We respect territory, understand hierarchy and reach decisions with enviable speed. True, we occasionally push things off tables for no clear reason, but this has nothing to do with Jakarta. If Jakarta were truly run like a clowder, it would suffer less crowding (we like our space), enjoy clearer lines of authority and function rather well, provided there were treats.

Yours, with a flick of my tail.

Bartleby’s guide to every business hotel room (December 13th) overlooked another one of their main attractions. State of the art showers that take 20 minutes to work out how to mix hot and cold water in the correct volume to avoid being burned or frozen, or flooding the bathroom, and in which you have to cower to be able to wash your hair.

JOÃO LUIS HAMBURGERSão Paulo

I, for one, am considering the need for advanced studies in both shower design and mechanical engineering to figure out which knobs and levers, only when perfectly synchronised of course, might provide for a predictable wash at a bearable temperature. Sadly and inevitably, I usually suffer through panicked moments of either scalding or frigid water ambushing me from an unsuspecting nozzle.

Brad PickBarcelona

Ask staff at reception for good places to eat and they will first recommend their hotel’s restaurant, where you can sit alone in a large empty dining room, or at the bar in the company of lonely-looking middle-aged men, and eat a $100 meal consisting of a bland hamburger, soggy fries, and a lightly portioned glass of industrial Californian wine.

Scott SimmonsDenver

“And God Created Woman” was the film that, as you say, made Brigitte Bardot famous (Obituary, January 3rd). I remember watching it in the 1950s when I was 15 years old. I have never forgotten the movie’s publicity tagline: “And God created woman…but the devil invented Brigitte Bardot.”

### Introductory Text
**English:** Letters are welcome via email to letters@economist.comFind out more about how we process your letter Your Christmas special review of Adam Smith and the “Wealth of Nations” at 250 seemed unseasonably uncharitable (“Adam Smith is misunderstood”, December 20th).

**Chinese:** 通过电子邮件欢迎来信至letters@economist.com了解更多我们如何处理您的来信。您圣诞特别版对亚当·斯密和《国富论》250周年的评论似乎不合时宜地过于苛刻（“亚当·斯密被误解了”，12月20日）。仔细寻找，你可以找到任何革命性思想的前身：牛顿的物理学、哥白尼的太阳系、达尔文的进化论、斯密的经济学。重要的是这些伟大思想家从中创造了什么。是的，斯密从各地收集观察。但他的天才在于展示那些看似不相干的观察如何融合成一个全面的、令人惊讶的现代经济生活理解。

### Letter 1 (Continuation)
**English:** Certainly, he made mistakes, as pioneers do. Is the labour theory of value one of them? Smith mentions it only in the context of a primitive world without capital. It had been accepted wisdom for two millennia. But he clearly wasn’t happy with it, and the rest of the book goes on to explore the “higgling and bargaining of the market” as a better guide. And who cares if Smith had never seen a pin factory? He made it a brilliant teaching to illustrate the thousandfold productivity gained from specialisation. Also, let’s not dismiss the “invisible hand” as a throwaway remark about a limited case.

So I shall wholeheartedly toast its 250th year, with a glass of claret (from France, of course, not Scotland). EAMONN BUTLERAdam Smith InstituteLondon  
**Chinese:** 当然，他犯了错误，正如先驱者所做的那样。劳动价值论是其中之一吗？斯密只在没有资本的原始世界背景下提到它。它已经是两千年来的公认智慧。但他显然对此不满意，书中其余部分继续探索“市场的讨价还价”作为更好的指导。而且谁在乎斯密是否从未见过别针工厂？他将其作为一个 brilliant 教学来说明从专业化中获得的千倍生产力。而且，不要将“看不见的手”贬低为关于有限情况的随意评论。整个《国富论》，以及他的《道德情操论》，都是对个人行动与整体社会秩序之间复杂关系的调查，这是弗里德里希·哈耶克（是他，而不是斯密，在玛格丽特·撒切尔的手提包里）将继续阐述的东西。《国富论》理所当然地产生了巨大影响，尤其是在开放世界贸易，从而提升人类福祉。因此，我将全心全意地为它的250周年干杯，用一杯红酒（当然来自法国，而不是苏格兰）。EAMONN BUTLER亚当·斯密研究所伦敦

Timothy TaylorSt Paul, Minnesota  
**Chinese:** 甚至标题《国富论》就是一个重要的概念突破。在斯密之前，标准信念是一个国家的财富由黄金和白银组成。在一个公认的冗长引言之后，他试图摧毁这个观念。例如，他指出西班牙人将国家财富视为黄金和白银，而成吉思汗的鞑靼人将国家财富视为牲畜。斯密写道：“两者中，鞑靼人的观念或许最接近真相。”斯密的观念，即一个国家的财富应该由其人民的消费来衡量，而不是其贸易顺差或政府的财富，仍然没有完全被学习。Timothy Taylor圣保罗，明尼苏达州

**Chinese:** 《国富论》250周年是一个极好的机会，让我们重新熟悉斯密在那本书和他的另一部伟大著作《道德情操论》（1759）中所说的内容。它们应该被视为互补的。斯密认为，一个健康的社会应该源于一个充满活力的经济。然而，我们生活在一个经济健康与社会健康脱节的世界。在许多国家，市场经济不再反映斯密所倡导的资本主义理想。相反，资本主义被追求经济租金的资本家劫持，有时得到政府青睐的支持。在许多市场中，政府的可见之手通过过度监管的负担挤出创业的无形之手。斯密警告需要监管银行以避免系统性风险，以及公司治理中固有的委托代理问题。他还影响了格奥尔格·威廉·弗里德里希·黑格尔的工作，黑格尔反过来影响了卡尔·马克思。在《卡尔·马克思经济思想的形成》中，欧内斯特·曼德尔指出，黑格尔“在青年时代深受经济学研究的影响，特别是亚当·斯密的作品。”约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯说，作为经济理论家争取对科学演变的独特贡献，没有人应该与亚当·斯密相比。哈耶克认为，斯密的作品超越了所有现代对塑造人类行为和社会影响的洞见。Joseph Healy墨尔本

**Chinese:** 许多人会同意您对英国民主因民粹和极端政党崛起而造成的担忧（“英国的老虎机政治”，12月6日）。这是一个谬误，认为这是由英国的代表性投票系统引起的（有些误导性地称为“胜者全得”）。几乎所有欧洲国家使用某种形式的比例代表制，并至少同样遭受民粹主义的崛起。那些提议比例代表制的人应该小心他们所愿。政党名单上的候选人不必吸引选民，并由政党机器选举，往往是比平均选民更极端的官僚主义者。对众多小党和单一议题党提供的奖励赋予极端观点不合理的权力。英国系统确保个别选民在国家政府中有个人代表，这是政党名单系统未能做到的，并倾向于奖励有广泛支持的政党。2011年，英国选民果断拒绝（68%对32%）自由民主党更温和的替代投票系统。Peter Gilmour伦敦

**Chinese:** Mark Leonard的邀请文章敦促欧洲应对MAGA挑战（12月13日）提供了一些表面解决方案来阻止中间主义的衰落。它可预测地避免处理房间里不断增长的大象。在中间派政府下，西方许多地方的平均实际工资已经停滞四十多年。当经济增长的大部分收益流向一小群幸运的个体，这些人普通公民一生中不太可能遇到时，对中间主义的热情减退就容易理解了。Tom Janson柏林
