# Mark Carney understands the new world, but can he survive it?

Canada’s leader must navigate a host of competing, fiendishly difficult, challenges

Mark Carney left Davos on January 21st with a swagger. Canada’s prime minister had entranced the global elite with a eulogy for the global rules-based order and a prescription for middle-power survival in the face of coercion from the likes of the United States and China. Surveys of public opinion carried out after his speech suggest that Canadians are rallying to his call (see chart). Mr Carney will need to draw on that political capital.

Donald Trump took aim immediately. He said Canada was “systematically destroying itself” and threatened 100% tariffs on all Canadian exports if “Canada makes a deal with China”. Scott Bessent, America’s treasury secretary, encouraged the secessionist movement in Alberta, saying the province should “come on down” and join the United States. A 30-minute phone call with Mr Trump on January 27th only confirmed Mr Carney’s assessment: “Washington has changed. There is almost nothing normal now in the United States.”

As well as handling wretched relations with Canada’s largest trading partner, Mr Carney must also reassure Canadians unnerved not just by constant threats to their sovereignty, but by damage to their livelihoods. The economy grew by just over 1% in 2025 despite Mr Trump’s tariffs. But sectoral duties pummelled the steel, car and aluminium industries in eastern Canada, leading to thousands of layoffs. The rising cost of food is causing anxiety. Visits to food banks reached an all-time high last year. Marc Miller, a minister, summed up the task after attending a cabinet meeting to discuss Canadian foreboding on January 23rd: “We have to focus on the end of the world, as well as the end of the month.”

Mr Carney responded with a tax break worth C$7,500 ($5,500) for poorer families over the next five years. China’s recent agreement to cut tariffs on Canada’s agricultural exports will prompt relief in western provinces like Saskatchewan, which send billions of dollars-worth of rapeseed to China every year. In exchange, Mr Carney agreed to drop Canada’s 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles to just 6.1% for at least the first 49,000 cars imported each year. Consumers may welcome access to cheap, high-quality vehicles.

The government must also handle secessionist movements in both the east and the west of the immense country. Polls suggest the separatist Parti Québécois (PQ) is poised to take control of the legislature in provincial elections no later than October. The party has promised to hold another independence referendum if elected. In a referendum in 1995 Quebec came within one percentage point—54,000 votes—of opting to leave the federation.

Alberta, the province with the highest GDP per person in Canada and the third-largest proven reserves of oil in the world, is the more immediate concern. It is frustrated with the federal government, whose regulations have limited Alberta’s ability to build infrastructure to export oil and gas via Canada’s west coast. Mr Bessent linked the Albertan desire for independence to its thwarted attempts to build pipelines.

Recent polling suggests that only 28% of Albertans would choose to leave Canada. But the sentiment is part of the reason Mr Carney signed an agreement with Alberta in November to fast-track the construction of an oil pipeline that would send 1m barrels daily to the Pacific coast for export. The province just needs to drum up the money. But many of the companies and pension funds that might finance the pipeline and other infrastructure complain privately that cumbersome environmental rules make investment too risky. Here, as on so many other issues, the prime minister must strike a delicate balance.

Keeping it will be all but impossible if Mr Trump abandons USMCA, the continental free-trade pact he renegotiated with Canada and Mexico in 2018, which Mr Trump now calls “irrelevant”. Few economists believe Mr Carney can attract the required investment without it. Thus Mr Carney’s middle power must find some kind of arrangement with the great one next door.

Despite his soaring popularity, Mr Carney still leads a government that is one seat short of a majority. His Liberals are working to tempt an opposing parliamentarian to cross the floor. Failing that, Canada’s good opinion of Mr Carney may tempt him to call a snap election. ■
