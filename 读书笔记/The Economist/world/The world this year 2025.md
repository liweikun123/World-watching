# The Year in Review: 2025

The first year of Donald Trump’s second term turned domestic and international politics on its head. The president withdrew America from the Paris accord on climate change, deployed the armed forces to crack down on migration at the border, ordered the National Guard into cities to help arrest illegal migrants, scrapped all diversity programmes in government, cancelled policies supporting renewable energy, attacked judges he disagreed with and renamed the Defence Department the Department of War. The fractious mood in America worsened with the murder in public of Charlie Kirk at a college in Utah, where students had come to debate his conservative politics.

Mr Trump also instigated tough trade policies, though the world economy remained remarkably resilient and is forecast to grow by around 3% in 2025. His big-bang “Liberation Day” tariffs in April led to the biggest fall in stockmarkets for the year. The S&P 500 tumbled by 4.9% in a day (and a further 6% on the following day) and the NASDAQ by 6%. Many tariffs were eventually lowered or postponed, however, leading stockmarkets to bounce back. Overall, they had another good year.

The bosses of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank joined Mr Trump at the White House soon after his inauguration to announce the Stargate project, a $500bn investment in the infrastructure for artificial intelligence. A new AI industrial policy emerged in America, with the government taking a 10% stake in Intel. The pace and size of AI deals were mind-boggling, $50bn here, $300bn there, and stocks in AI-related companies soared. Nvidia became the world’s first $4trn company, and just a few months later the first $5trn one (albeit briefly). Investors have some doubts, however, about whether all that spending on AI will produce profits. Stocks swooned in January when DeepSeek, a Chinese firm, developed an AI model at a fraction of the cost of ChatGPT and the rest.

A ceasefire eventually came into force in Gaza, in large part because of the pressure Mr Trump put on Israel and Hamas and some energetic shuttle diplomacy by his envoys. America unveiled an ambitious peace plan for the region that was given a cautious welcome. The remaining Israeli hostages were freed by Hamas and Israel allowed in some aid for Gaza’s hungry and shattered residents. Skirmishes continue and the peace remains fragile. Israel bombed Iran, wiping out a number of senior regime officials, including the chief of staff of the armed forces and the head of the Islamic revolutionary guard, as well as 11 nuclear scientists. During the 12-day campaign America dropped bunker-busting bombs on Iran’s uranium-enrichment facilities. Iran made a symbolic retaliation by firing missiles at America’s military base in Qatar.

In December two gunmen killed at least 15 people at a Jewish event at Sydney’s Bondi Beach. The gunmen were followers of Islamic State and had spent time in the southern Philippines, were IS is active. Earlier in the year a Syrian-born man attacked a synagogue in Manchester. He fatally stabbed one person and the police accidentally killed another. And a Palestinian sympathiser shot dead two Israeli embassy staff outside a Jewish museum in Washington.

America’s new national security strategy proclaimed its dominance in the Western Hemisphere. For the first time America’s armed forces attacked suspected drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. Mr Trump threatened to bomb or even invade Venezuela to oust Nicolás Maduro as president. Colombia was decertified as a partner in fighting drugs; Mr Trump called its leftist president an “illegal drug leader”. Violence rose in the country. Miguel Uribe Turbay, a conservative presidential candidate, was fatally shot at a rally. Mr Trump also floated using force to take control of the Panama Canal. Not all Latin American countries fell out with him. El Salvador struck a deal to house deported drug criminals from America in its prisons.

Jair Bolsonaro, a former president of Brazil, was found guilty by the country’s Supreme Court of conspiring to launch a coup after he lost an election in 2022 and sentenced to 27 years in prison. At the end of the year the Brazilian Congress passed a bill that could reduce that sentence to as little as two years, though this would have to be approved by the court.

Elon Musk was put in charge of the new Department of Government Efficiency, which recommended the mass firing of federal workers (317,000 left their jobs for one reason or another). But Mr Musk fell out with Mr Trump over the president’s “big beautiful” tax-cutting bill, which increased the deficit. A row in Congress over health care meant that a bill to renew federal spending was delayed, leading to America’s longest-ever government shutdown.

Mr Musk was awarded a remuneration package by Tesla worth up to $1trn (depending on very ambitious performance targets). Tesla had a mixed year, recording steep declines in deliveries. The pace of growth in the demand for pure electric vehicles stalled in America and Europe, but sales of hybrids increased. Recognising the new reality, the EU eased a plan to ban sales of new petrol-engine cars by 2035; now emissions will have to be 90%. Norway was a notable exception to the EV reversal. Nearly 100% of new car sales in the country were electric.

The worst military conflict in decades broke out between India and Pakistan, sparked by a terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir that killed 26 people. India blamed Pakistan for giving succour to the attackers and fired missiles at what it said were terrorist bases in Pakistan. Pakistan responded with drone and missile strikes. Tensions remain high; incidents such as a deadly car bomb near the Red Fort in Delhi haven’t helped.

The year’s other big stories from Asia included the removal from office of Yoon Suk Yeol as South Korea’s president, following his imposition of martial law in late 2024. A subsequent election was won by Lee Jae Myung of the Democratic Party. Japan got its first female prime minister. Takaichi Sanae is described as the country’s Margaret Thatcher. She has the same proclivity for controversy, soon starting a full-on diplomatic row with China over Taiwan. In Thailand the Constitutional Court dismissed Paetongtarn Shinawatra as prime minister after an ill-advised phone call she placed with Hun Sen, an influential Cambodian politician, amid border clashes between the two countries.

A devastating earthquake and aftershocks struck Myanmar, killing at least 5,500 people. The epicentre was close to Mandalay but the quake also caused damage in Vietnam and Thailand. A skyscraper that was under construction in Bangkok collapsed, killing about 95 people. Afghanistan was also hit by a large earthquake in which some 2,200 people died.

The war in Ukraine raged on, with Russia making (extremely limited) territorial gains. The Trump administration waxed and waned in its support of Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelensky’s visit to the White House in February was a disaster. He was berated by the president and J.D. Vance, the vice-president, in a public confrontation that was unprecedented for any world leader. Later in the year Ukraine rattled Russia by launching drone attacks on air bases and refineries deep inside the country. A much ballyhooed summit in August between Mr Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska came to naught. The year ended with America pushing a peace plan.

The Christian Democrats came first in Germany’s snap election, at which the populist-right Alternative for Germany got its best-ever result. Friedrich Merz, the new chancellor, said that Europe could no longer rely on America for its defence and loosened Germany’s constitutional “debt brake” in order to ramp up spending on weapons and infrastructure. France saw François Bayrou resign as prime minister over a budget row in the National Assembly. Sébastien Lecornu also resigned, after less than a month in the job, only to be reappointed by Emmanuel Macron.

The civil war in Sudan took a turn for the worse when el-Fasher, the besieged capital of Darfur, fell to the rebel Rapid Support Forces. The RSF, which is descended from the mostly Arab Janjaweed militias, went on a killing spree in the city. America has accused it of genocide. The office of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court expressed “profound alarm” over possible war crimes.

The conflict also intensified in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where Goma, the biggest city in the region, fell to M23 rebels backed by Rwanda. The Congolese and Rwandan presidents eventually signed a peace deal in Washington towards the end of the year, though the fighting continued to rage on the ground.

Mark Carney became Canada’s prime minister following the resignation of Justin Trudeau. An election in April returned the Liberals to office leading yet another minority government. Mr Carney promised to “stand up” to America. During a meeting at the White House with Mr Trump Mr Carney said Canada was not for sale.

Los Angeles had a tough year. Wildfires destroyed the wealthy Pacific Palisades neighbourhood in January, killing 12 people and razing 6,837 structures to the ground. A man was eventually charged with arson in October. The first house to be rebuilt was finished in November. During the summer riots broke out in the city in response to the crackdown on migrants. On the opposite coast, New York elected Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, as mayor. Mr Mamdani has promised to put affordable housing at the heart of his agenda when he takes office on January 1st.

Following the death of Pope Francis the Vatican conclave elected Cardinal Robert Prevost as pope, the first pontiff to hail from the United States. Pope Leo’s first foreign tour took him to Turkey, and Lebanon, where about 40% of the population is Christian.

Bishop Sarah Mullally was appointed as the first female Archbishop of Canterbury, following the resignation of Justin Welby in 2024. She is due to start the job early in 2026, but like her predecessor she has already become mired in scandal relating to the handling of allegations of sexual abuse by Church of England clergy.

It was a year of political upheaval in Turkey. Protests erupted following the arrest of the mayor of Istanbul, the main opposition figure to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on what his supporters claim are politically motivated corruption charges. Turkey’s markets plunged in response. In a historic decision the Kurdish Worker’s Party (PKK), which Turkey, America and the EU describe as a terrorist group, laid down its arms and said it would dissolve itself after four decades of conflict.

The American economy remained strong. Throughout the year Mr Trump put pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and sought to remove Lisa Cook from the Fed’s board of governors; the Supreme Court will hold a hearing in January to determine if he has the power to do so. The Fed eventually started to reduce rates in September. Many other central banks, including the European Central Bank and Bank of England, also cut rates.

In Britain polling showed that Sir Keir Starmer is one of the most unpopular prime ministers ever, and Rachel Reeves, his tax-raising, welfare-spending chancellor, the most unpopular person in her job. Angela Rayner quit as deputy prime minister for not paying a property tax (she was also the housing minister). The populist-right Reform UK surged ahead in the polls. Even the Greens are polling as well as Labour. Sir Keir can take some Christmas comfort that the Tories are doing just as bad.

Warren Buffett decided to retire as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, a company he has led for six decades. At 95, the Oracle of Omaha will stay on as chairman when he passes the CEO job to Greg Abel in January. Berkshire’s stock has risen by 6,000,000% since 1965, outperforming the S&P 500, which is up by 46,000% over that period.

唐纳德·特朗普第二任期的第一年彻底颠覆了美国国内和国际政治。总统让美国退出《巴黎气候协定》，派遣武装部队在边境打击非法移民，命令国民警卫队进入城市协助逮捕非法移民，废除政府所有多元化项目，取消支持可再生能源的政策，攻击他不同意的法官，并将国防部改名为战争部。美国国内的分裂气氛进一步恶化，保守派人士Charlie Kirk在犹他州一所大学公开被谋杀，当时学生们前来辩论他的保守政治观点。

特朗普先生还推行强硬的贸易政策，尽管全球经济表现出惊人的韧性，预计2025年增长约3%。他在4月推出的“大爆炸”式“解放日”关税导致当年股市最大跌幅。标普500指数一天内暴跌4.9%（次日再跌6%），纳斯达克指数跌6%。不过，许多关税最终被降低或推迟，导致股市反弹。总体而言，股市又度过了不错的一年。

OpenAI、Oracle和软银的老板在特朗普就职后不久加入他在白宫的活动，宣布“星际之门”项目——一项5000亿美元的投资，用于人工智能基础设施。美国出现了新的AI产业政策，政府持有英特尔10%的股份。AI交易的规模和速度令人震惊，这里500亿美元，那里3000亿美元，AI相关公司股价飙升。英伟达成为全球首家市值4万亿美元的公司，几个月后又短暂成为首家5万亿美元的公司（尽管只是短暂的）。然而，投资者对所有这些AI支出是否能产生利润仍存疑虑。1月份，当中国公司DeepSeek以远低于ChatGPT等模型的成本开发出AI模型时，股市出现动荡。

加沙最终实现停火，主要归功于特朗普对以色列和哈马斯的压力，以及其特使们积极的穿梭外交。美国公布了一项雄心勃勃的中东和平计划，获得谨慎欢迎。剩余的以色列人质被哈马斯释放，以色列允许部分援助进入加沙饥饿和破碎的居民区。小规模冲突仍在继续，和平仍很脆弱。以色列轰炸伊朗，消灭多名高级政权官员，包括武装部队参谋长和伊斯兰革命卫队负责人，以及11名核科学家。在为期12天的战役中，美国向伊朗的铀浓缩设施投掷了钻地炸弹。伊朗象征性地进行报复，向美国在卡塔尔的军事基地发射导弹。

12月，两名枪手在悉尼邦迪海滩的一个犹太活动上杀死至少15人。枪手是伊斯兰国的追随者，曾在伊斯兰国活跃的菲律宾南部逗留。今年早些时候，一名叙利亚出生的男子袭击了曼彻斯特的一座犹太会堂。他致命刺伤一人，警方意外杀死另一人。一名巴勒斯坦同情者在美国华盛顿的一座犹太博物馆外枪杀了两名以色列大使馆工作人员。

美国的新国家安全战略宣称其在西半球的主导地位。美国武装部队首次攻击加勒比海和东太平洋涉嫌贩毒的船只。特朗普威胁轰炸或甚至入侵委内瑞拉，以推翻总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗。哥伦比亚被取消作为打击毒品伙伴的资格；特朗普称其左翼总统为“非法毒品领袖”。该国暴力事件上升。保守派总统候选人米格尔·乌里韦·图尔拜在集会上被致命枪击。特朗普还提出使用武力控制巴拿马运河。并非所有拉美国家都与他交恶。萨尔瓦多达成协议，在其监狱中收容从美国遣返的毒品罪犯。

巴西前总统雅伊尔·博索纳罗被该国最高法院裁定在2022年选举失败后密谋发动政变罪名成立，被判27年监禁。年底，巴西国会通过一项法案，可能将刑期减至仅2年，尽管这需经法院批准。

埃隆·马斯克被任命负责新成立的政府效率部，该部门建议大规模解雇联邦雇员（317,000人因各种原因离职）。但马斯克因特朗普总统的“大而美丽”的减税法案（该法案增加赤字）而与特朗普闹翻。国会关于医疗保健的争吵导致联邦支出续签法案延迟，引发美国有史以来最长的政府关门。

马斯克获特斯拉授予一份价值高达1万亿美元的薪酬方案（取决于非常雄心勃勃的业绩目标）。特斯拉度过了起伏的一年，交付量大幅下降。纯电动汽车需求增长步伐在美国和欧洲停滞，但混合动力车销量增加。认识到新现实，欧盟放松了到2035年禁止销售新汽油发动机的计划；现在排放标准需达到90%。挪威是电动汽车逆转的一个显著例外。该国几乎100%的新车销售都是电动的。

数十年来最严重的军事冲突在印度和巴基斯坦之间爆发，由查谟和克什米尔地区一起恐怖袭击引发，造成26人死亡。印度指责巴基斯坦为袭击者提供庇护，并向其声称的巴基斯坦境内恐怖基地发射导弹。巴基斯坦以无人机和导弹打击作为回应。紧张局势依然高企；诸如德里红堡附近致命汽车炸弹等事件无助于缓和。

亚洲今年的其他重大事件包括韩国总统尹锡悦因2024年底实施戒严令而被免职。随后举行的选举由民主党人李在明赢得。日本迎来了首位女首相。高市早苗被形容为日本的玛格丽特·撒切尔。她同样喜欢制造争议，很快因台湾问题与中国展开全面外交争端。在泰国，宪法法院因帕通坦·钦那瓦与柬埔寨有影响力政客洪森的不明智通话（当时两国正因边境冲突紧张）而罢免了她总理职务。

一场毁灭性的地震及其余震袭击了缅甸，至少造成5500人死亡。震中靠近曼德勒，但地震也在越南和泰国造成破坏。曼谷一栋在建摩天大楼倒塌，造成约95人死亡。阿富汗也遭受了一次大地震，造成约2200人死亡。

乌克兰战争持续激烈，俄罗斯取得（极其有限的）领土进展。特朗普政府对乌克兰的支持时强时弱。泽连斯基2月访问白宫成为一场灾难。他在公开对峙中遭到总统和副总统J.D.万斯的斥责，这对任何世界领袖来说都是前所未有的。后来在年内，乌克兰通过对俄罗斯境内深处空军基地和炼油厂的无人机袭击震动了俄罗斯。8月特朗普与普京在阿拉斯加备受炒作的峰会无果而终。该年以美国推动一项和平计划结束。

基督教民主党在德国的闪电大选中位居首位，民粹右翼的德国选择党取得了有史以来最好的成绩。新任总理弗里德里希·梅尔茨表示，欧洲不能再依赖美国防务，并放松德国宪法的“债务刹车”，以增加武器和基础设施支出。法国方面，弗朗索瓦·贝鲁因国民议会预算争端辞去总理职务。塞巴斯蒂安·勒科努在上任不到一个月后辞职，随后又被埃马纽埃尔·马克龙重新任命。

苏丹内战进一步恶化，被围困的达尔富尔首府法希尔落入反叛的快速支援部队手中。该部队主要源于阿拉伯裔民兵简贾威德，在城市中大开杀戒。美国指控其犯下种族灭绝罪。国际刑事法院检察官办公室对可能的战争罪行表示“深切担忧”。

刚果民主共和国东部的冲突也加剧，该地区最大城市戈马落入卢旺达支持的M23叛军手中。刚果和卢旺达总统年底在华盛顿签署和平协议，尽管地面战斗仍在激烈进行。

马克·卡尼在贾斯廷·特鲁多辞职后成为加拿大总理。4月的选举让自由党再次执政，组成又一个少数派政府。卡尼先生承诺“对抗”美国。在白宫与特朗普会晤时，卡尼表示加拿大不出售。

洛杉矶度过了艰难的一年。1月野火摧毁了富裕的太平洋帕利塞兹社区，造成12人死亡，6837座建筑被夷为平地。一名男子最终在10月被控纵火。11月，第一栋重建房屋完工。夏季，因打击移民行动，该市爆发骚乱。在东海岸对岸，纽约选举民主社会主义者佐赫兰·曼达尼为市长。曼达尼承诺在上任1月1日后，将负担得起的住房置于其议程核心。

教皇方济各逝世后，梵蒂冈枢机主教团选举美国出生的罗伯特·普雷沃斯特枢机为教皇，他是首位来自美国的教皇。利奥教皇的首次出访前往土耳其和黎巴嫩，后者约40%人口为基督徒。

莎拉·穆拉利主教被任命为坎特伯雷首位女大主教，接替2024年辞职的贾斯廷·韦尔比。她预计2026年初上任，但像前任一样，她已卷入处理英国国教会神职人员性虐待指控的丑闻。

土耳其经历了政治动荡的一年。伊斯坦布尔市长——埃尔多安总统的主要反对派人物——因其支持者称的政治动机腐败指控被捕，随后爆发抗议。土耳其市场随之暴跌。在一项历史性决定中，被土耳其、美国和欧盟列为恐怖组织的库尔德工人党（PKK）放下武器，并表示将在四十年冲突后解散自身。

美国经济保持强劲。全年特朗普向美联储施压要求降息，并试图移除美联储理事丽莎·库克；最高法院将于1月举行听证会，确定他是否有此权力。美联储最终在9月开始降息。包括欧洲央行和英格兰银行在内的许多其他央行也降息。

在英国，民调显示基尔·斯塔默爵士是有史以来最不受欢迎的首相之一，他的加税、增加福利支出的财政大臣雷切尔·里夫斯则是该职位上最不受欢迎的人。安吉拉·雷纳因未缴房产税（她同时还是住房大臣）而辞去副首相职务。民粹右翼的改革英国党在民调中大幅领先。甚至绿党民调也与工党相当。斯塔默爵士可以在圣诞节稍感安慰，因为保守党表现同样糟糕。

沃伦·巴菲特决定从他领导六十年的伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司退休。这位95岁的奥马哈先知将在1月将首席执行官职位交给格雷格·阿贝尔后，继续担任董事长。自1965年以来，伯克希尔股票上涨了6,000,000%，超越标普500指数同期46,000%的涨幅。
