> Donald Trump met Xi Jinping in South Korea, their first face-to-face encounter since the American president took office in January. Mr Trump described their meeting as “amazing” and said China had agreed to a one-year trade deal and had promised to loosen its restrictions on exports of rare earths. Mr Trump also confirmed that China had made progress in reducing the flow of fentanyl from the country and he would therefore reduce the level of tariffs he had imposed on Chinese goods. Shortly before the meeting Mr Trump threatened to resume nuclear testing, but gave no details about what he meant.

> Mr Trump earlier imposed an extra 10% levy on Canadian goods in retaliation for a TV ad aired by the government of Ontario province that had used a clip of Ronald Reagan criticising the use of tariffs. Seemingly annoyed by Ontario’s ad, Mark Carney, Canada’s prime minister, pointed out that only the federal government has responsibility for trade.

> Afghanistan and Pakistan said they would resume peace talks in Istanbul, a day after an announcement that they had ended in failure. The talks are aimed at finding a solution to hostilities between the two countries, which recently erupted into fighting along their border, killing dozens of people. Smaller skirmishes have continued despite a ceasefire. Pakistan accuses Afghanistan of giving succour to the Pakistani Taliban.

> A general election in the Netherlands produced a tight result. D66, a liberal party led by Rob Jetten, won the same number of seats as the hard right Party for Freedom (PVV), led by Geert Wilders. PVV had won the previous election in 2023. But no mainstream party will now deal with the PVV, so Mr Jetten looks likely to be the next prime minister.

> Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine was ready to hold peace talks with Russia, and would even consider Hungary as a venue, but he would not pull back Ukrainian troops from the conflict, a Russian precondition for negotiations. A few days earlier European leaders failed to agree on a plan to use frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine.
