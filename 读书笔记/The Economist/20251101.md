> Donald Trump met Xi Jinping in South Korea, their first face-to-face encounter since the American president took office in January. Mr Trump described their meeting as “amazing” and said China had agreed to a one-year trade deal and had promised to loosen its restrictions on exports of rare earths. Mr Trump also confirmed that China had made progress in reducing the flow of fentanyl from the country and he would therefore reduce the level of tariffs he had imposed on Chinese goods. Shortly before the meeting Mr Trump threatened to resume nuclear testing, but gave no details about what he meant.

> Mr Trump earlier imposed an extra 10% levy on Canadian goods in retaliation for a TV ad aired by the government of Ontario province that had used a clip of Ronald Reagan criticising the use of tariffs. Seemingly annoyed by Ontario’s ad, Mark Carney, Canada’s prime minister, pointed out that only the federal government has responsibility for trade.

> Afghanistan and Pakistan said they would resume peace talks in Istanbul, a day after an announcement that they had ended in failure. The talks are aimed at finding a solution to hostilities between the two countries, which recently erupted into fighting along their border, killing dozens of people. Smaller skirmishes have continued despite a ceasefire. Pakistan accuses Afghanistan of giving succour to the Pakistani Taliban.

> A general election in the Netherlands produced a tight result. D66, a liberal party led by Rob Jetten, won the same number of seats as the hard right Party for Freedom (PVV), led by Geert Wilders. PVV had won the previous election in 2023. But no mainstream party will now deal with the PVV, so Mr Jetten looks likely to be the next prime minister.

> Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine was ready to hold peace talks with Russia, and would even consider Hungary as a venue, but he would not pull back Ukrainian troops from the conflict, a Russian precondition for negotiations. A few days earlier European leaders failed to agree on a plan to use frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine.

> Catherine Connolly won Ireland’s presidential election. Ms Connolly ran as an independent but was backed by Sinn Féin and other parties of the left. Although the presidency is a mostly ceremonial role, Ms Connolly is a fierce defender of Irish neutrality at a time when the European Union is seeking greater commitments to collective defence.

近代：社会主义为左；资本主义为右：这是近代最广为所知的分法，多数媒体提到左右翼时，也多半是指此种分法。这里的社会主义泛指高税收、高福利、高政府干预调控的政治体制，而不一定是共产党主张的无产阶级专政。

综合整个历史：左翼 偏向革新、极端；右翼 偏向保守、稳定。

一般来说，左翼支持平等，反对阶级统治，其强调的特点是“(个人)自由、平等、博爱、权利、进步、改革和国际主义等观念”；[11][12][13]而右翼认为社会分层有其自然性和不可避免性[14][15]，其强调的特点是“权力、等级、秩序、责任、传统、反变革和民族主义等观念”[16]。

在范围上，左翼通常包含进步主义、社会主义[17]、共产主义[18]、社会自由主义、社会民主主义、民主社会主义[19]、世俗主义、平等主义、左翼民粹主义、左翼民族主义、反帝国主义、反资本主义、自由意志社会主义、左翼自由意志主义[20][21]、民族自决论、国际主义、无政府共产主义、无政府社会主义[22]。种族平等运动和工会主义运动也与左翼息息相关[23][24]。

而右翼通常包含保守主义、右翼自由意志主义[25]、保守自由主义、自由保守主义、反共主义、右翼民粹主义、纳粹主义、种族民族主义、法西斯主义[26]、无政府资本主义[27][28]、资本主义、新自由主义、新保守主义、帝国主义、君主主义[29]、反变革主义[30]和传统主义。[31]

> Hurricane Melissa left much of Jamaica without electricity and communications. Recording sustained winds of up to 300kmh (185 miles per hour) it was the strongest-ever storm to hit the island. It barrelled on to Cuba and the Bahamas packing a less severe punch. Around 35 people have been killed by the storm, including in Haiti, a toll that is likely to rise.
