> Donald Trump met Xi Jinping in South Korea, their first face-to-face encounter since the American president took office in January. Mr Trump described their meeting as “amazing” and said China had agreed to a one-year trade deal and had promised to loosen its restrictions on exports of rare earths. Mr Trump also confirmed that China had made progress in reducing the flow of fentanyl from the country and he would therefore reduce the level of tariffs he had imposed on Chinese goods. Shortly before the meeting Mr Trump threatened to resume nuclear testing, but gave no details about what he meant.
