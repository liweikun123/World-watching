# Patriotism tests loom for big business

Economic nationalism makes it harder for multinationals to navigate the world

FOR CHINESE fans of table tennis, even global tournaments have a cosy feel. China so dominates the sport that many international matches amount to a contest between “our Chinese” and “their Chinese”. Fans in China proudly watch their country’s champions compete with members of the “ping-pong foreign legion”, their fond nickname for Chinese-born aces who, realising they will never make their national squad, emigrate to play under other flags. At the Paris Olympics in 2024 more than a dozen table-tennis players representing European, Latin American and other countries were Chinese-born and -trained.

If Chinese state planners have their way, economic globalisation is about to take a similar turn. It is their hope that some of the fastest-growing industries will soon be dominated by Chinese companies, or by foreign firms that depend on Chinese supply chains. Either way, the real winner will be China. In Beijing and other capitals, business bosses and officials expect to hear the phrase “China goes global” a lot in 2026. More Chinese companies will open or expand overseas operations, trying to ease trade tensions by creating jobs abroad. Some operations will distribute fully made-in-China products, such as affordable, gadget-packed electric vehicles or high-performance batteries. Others will send semi-finished kits to assembly plants far from home, transferring just enough value to be seen as local manufacturers.

Chinese firms are already hearing loud demands from European and other governments to transfer more advanced technologies to foreign partners, and to source more components from local supply chains. The European Union is debating “buy European” local-content rules for public procurement contracts, in a bid to give such demands some bite. Still, many Chinese businesses will try to keep their most valuable operations at home. Cheaper labour and government subsidies are not the only reason. China offers efficient industrial clusters, low-cost and abundant energy, modern infrastructure and economies of scale. For a country run by communists, it is a deeply conservative place, where strikes are illegal and workers do as they are told. Why, Chinese officials privately ask, would anyone open a business in France, with its high costs and stroppy trade unions?

Many Chinese investments should be welcome. But governments should not be naive about promises by Chinese firms to build fully localised sites for advanced manufacturing, says a Western trade official. When weighing support for inward investments, assessments of the national interest should assume that Chinese firms will mostly ship in components for final assembly.

In other cases, “China goes global” will involve Chinese subsidiaries of foreign firms competing head-to-head with their own parent companies. With profits scarce inside China, many firms must seek fatter margins abroad. Once-swaggering German car companies now export electric cars from China to Europe that are Chinese in all but name. These models are not just 40% cheaper to build in Chinese plants, but draw deeply on Chinese innovation. Some Japanese electronics firms use so much made-in-China technology that they are arguably Chinese.

Jens Eskelund, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China and a longtime business executive in Beijing, has watched the rationale for investing in China change over the years. In the 1990s and 2000s Western companies sought to profit from China’s low costs and by selling into its large (though tricky) home market. Today he sees more European companies investing in China “for survival”. Among his chamber’s member companies, twice as many are moving production into China as are reducing activities there. In part they are trying to navigate geopolitical tensions by manufacturing “in China, for China”.

But more importantly, companies also feel that they must be “in China, for the world”. Almost every Western firm active in global trade now faces at least one peer, or near-peer, competitor from China. Those Chinese rivals are given an edge by their access to hyper-competitive Chinese suppliers and industrial clusters. To survive, many Western firms believe they must tap into the same Chinese expertise. “If you are going to compete in globalised sectors, you have to get the best components at the best price. That means leveraging Chinese supply chains,” says Mr Eskelund.

If the economic case for made-in-China globalisation is strong, at least in some industries, the politics are perilous. In the near future more China-based subsidiaries will face complaints that they are cannibalising the worldwide sales of their parent companies, raising fears of job losses back home. China-based joint ventures will increasingly develop world-class intellectual property or generate valuable data that cannot be shared with their multinational owners (and vice versa) due to Chinese and Western security laws. Made-in-China success may be good for multinationals’ shareholders. Home governments will need to be convinced that what is good for their largest companies is also good for their country.

In their own ways, America, China and Europe are all becoming more protectionist. Their aim is not to end foreign trade, but to capture more of its benefits. President Donald Trump has bullied allies into promising huge investments in his country. In South Korea, one of his targets, insiders worry about a political backlash. New American plants may profit Korean carmakers, they say. But all South Koreans need to see visible gains for their country.

This is a tricky moment for big businesses to navigate. The nationality of a global firm is becoming more important but more ambiguous. Political trust is in short supply. Public opinion can tolerate a single country dominating ping-pong, it turns out. Consent for globalisation requires wins to be shared more evenly. ■

FOR CHINESE fans of table tennis, even global tournaments have a cosy feel. China so dominates the sport that many international matches amount to a contest between “our Chinese” and “their Chinese”. Fans in China proudly watch their country’s champions compete with members of the “ping-pong foreign legion”, their fond nickname for Chinese-born aces who, realising they will never make their national squad, emigrate to play under other flags. At the Paris Olympics in 2024 more than a dozen table-tennis players representing European, Latin American and other countries were Chinese-born and -trained.
对于中国的乒乓球粉丝来说，即便是在全球性赛事中，也会有一种亲切感。中国在这一运动中占据了绝对的主导地位，以至于许多国际比赛实际上成了“我们的中国人”对阵“他们的中国人”。中国观众会自豪地看着本国冠军与“海外乒乓军团”较量——这是他们对那些深知无法进入中国国家队，从而移民到其他国旗下的华裔顶尖高手的亲昵称呼。在 2024 年巴黎奥运会上，有超过十名代表欧洲、拉美等国参赛的乒乓球运动员是在中国出生并接受训练的。

If Chinese state planners have their way, economic globalisation is about to take a similar turn. It is their hope that some of the fastest-growing industries will soon be dominated by Chinese companies, or by foreign firms that depend on Chinese supply chains. Either way, the real winner will be China. In Beijing and other capitals, business bosses and officials expect to hear the phrase “China goes global” a lot in 2026. More Chinese companies will open or expand overseas operations, trying to ease trade tensions by creating jobs abroad. Some operations will distribute fully made-in-China products, such as affordable, gadget-packed electric vehicles or high-performance batteries. Others will send semi-finished kits to assembly plants far from home, transferring just enough value to be seen as local manufacturers.
如果中国政府的计划得以实现，经济全球化也将迎来类似的转折。他们希望一些增长最快的行业很快将由中国公司主导，或者由依赖中国供应链的外国公司主导。无论哪种方式，真正的赢家都将是中国。在北京和其他国家的首都，商界领袖和官员们预计在 2026 年将频繁听到“中国走向全球”这一说法。更多的中国公司将开设或扩大海外业务，试图通过在海外创造就业机会来缓解贸易摩擦。有些业务将分销纯正的“中国制造”产品，如价格亲民、科技感十足的电动汽车或高性能电池。另一些则会将半成品套件运往远在海外的组装厂，只转移刚好足够的价值，以便被视作当地制造商。

Chinese firms are already hearing loud demands from European and other governments to transfer more advanced technologies to foreign partners, and to source more components from local supply chains. The European Union is debating “buy European” local-content rules for public procurement contracts, in a bid to give such demands some bite. Still, many Chinese businesses will try to keep their most valuable operations at home. Cheaper labour and government subsidies are not the only reason. China offers efficient industrial clusters, low-cost and abundant energy, modern infrastructure and economies of scale. For a country run by communists, it is a deeply conservative place, where strikes are illegal and workers do as they are told. Why, Chinese officials privately ask, would anyone open a business in France, with its high costs and stroppy trade unions?
中国企业已经感受到来自欧洲和其他政府的强烈要求：要求其向外国合作伙伴转移更先进的技术，并从当地供应链采购更多零部件。欧盟正在讨论针对公共采购合同的“购买欧洲货”本地含量规则，旨在让这些要求更具强制力。尽管如此，许多中国企业仍会尝试将最核心的业务留在国内。廉价劳动力和政府补贴并非唯一原因，中国还拥有高效的产业集群、低廉且充足的能源、现代化的基础设施和规模经济。对于一个由共产党执政的国家来说，这里在某些方面极为保守：罢工是非法的，工人服从指令。中国官员私下质疑：为什么会有人想在成本高昂且工会难搞的法国开办业务？

Many Chinese investments should be welcome. But governments should not be naive about promises by Chinese firms to build fully localised sites for advanced manufacturing, says a Western trade official. When weighing support for inward investments, assessments of the national interest should assume that Chinese firms will mostly ship in components for final assembly.
一位西方贸易官员表示，许多中国投资本应受到欢迎，但各国政府不应对中国企业建立“完全本地化”先进制造基地的承诺过于天真。在评估对引入投资的支持时，国家利益评估应假设中国企业大多只会运送零部件进行最终组装。

In other cases, “China goes global” will involve Chinese subsidiaries of foreign firms competing head-to-head with their own parent companies. With profits scarce inside China, many firms must seek fatter margins abroad. Once-swaggering German car companies now export electric cars from China to Europe that are Chinese in all but name. These models are not just  cheaper to build in Chinese plants, but draw deeply on Chinese innovation. Some Japanese electronics firms use so much made-in-China technology that they are arguably Chinese.
在其他情况下，“中国走向全球”将涉及跨国公司的中国子公司与其母公司开展正面竞争。由于中国国内利润稀薄，许多公司必须在海外寻求更高的利润空间。曾经趾高气昂的德国车企，如今正从中国向欧洲出口除了品牌以外几乎全是“中国制造”的电动汽车。这些车型在中国工厂的生产成本不仅便宜 ，还深度借鉴了中国的创新。一些日本电子企业使用了如此多的中国技术，以至于它们在论证上几乎可以算作中国公司。

Jens Eskelund, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China and a longtime business executive in Beijing, has watched the rationale for investing in China change over the years. In the 1990s and 2000s Western companies sought to profit from China’s low costs and by selling into its large (though tricky) home market. Today he sees more European companies investing in China “for survival”. Among his chamber’s member companies, twice as many are moving production into China as are reducing activities there. In part they are trying to navigate geopolitical tensions by manufacturing “in China, for China”.
中国欧盟商会主席、长期在北京担任高管的彦斯·埃斯凯伦（Jens Eskelund）观察到，多年来在华投资的逻辑已发生变化。在 20 世纪 90 年代和 21 世纪初，西方公司寻求利用中国的低成本并向其庞大（虽棘手）的国内市场销售。如今，他看到更多欧洲公司为了“生存”而投资中国。在其商会成员公司中，将生产转移到中国的公司数量是减少在华活动公司的两倍。一方面，他们试图通过“在中国，为中国”的模式来规避地缘政治张力。

But more importantly, companies also feel that they must be “in China, for the world”. Almost every Western firm active in global trade now faces at least one peer, or near-peer, competitor from China. Those Chinese rivals are given an edge by their access to hyper-competitive Chinese suppliers and industrial clusters. To survive, many Western firms believe they must tap into the same Chinese expertise. “If you are going to compete in globalised sectors, you have to get the best components at the best price. That means leveraging Chinese supply chains,” says Mr Eskelund.
但更重要的是，公司觉得必须“在中国，为全球”。几乎每家活跃在全球贸易中的西方公司现在都面临至少一个来自中国的同行或近乎同行的竞争对手。这些中国对手凭借能够获得竞争极其激烈的中国供应商和产业集群而占据优势。为了生存，许多西方公司认为必须利用同样的中国专业技术。埃斯凯伦表示：“如果你要在全球化行业竞争，就必须以最优价格获得最好的零部件。这意味着必须利用中国供应链。”

If the economic case for made-in-China globalisation is strong, at least in some industries, the politics are perilous. In the near future more China-based subsidiaries will face complaints that they are cannibalising the worldwide sales of their parent companies, raising fears of job losses back home. China-based joint ventures will increasingly develop world-class intellectual property or generate valuable data that cannot be shared with their multinational owners (and vice versa) due to Chinese and Western security laws. Made-in-China success may be good for multinationals’ shareholders. Home governments will need to be convinced that what is good for their largest companies is also good for their country.
如果说“中国制造全球化”的经济理由在某些行业很充分，那么其政治风险则是致命的。在不久的将来，更多位于中国的子公司将面临“蚕食母公司全球销售额”的指控，引发国内失业的担忧。由于中西方的安全法律，在华合资企业将越来越多地开发出无法与跨国母公司共享（反之亦然）的世界级知识产权或价值数据。“中国制造”的成功可能对跨国公司的股东有利，但本国政府需要被说服：对大公司有利的事情是否也对国家有利。

In their own ways, America, China and Europe are all becoming more protectionist. Their aim is not to end foreign trade, but to capture more of its benefits. President Donald Trump has bullied allies into promising huge investments in his country. In South Korea, one of his targets, insiders worry about a political backlash. New American plants may profit Korean carmakers, they say. But all South Koreans need to see visible gains for their country.
美国、中国和欧洲都在以各自的方式变得更加保护主义。其目的不是结束对外贸易，而是攫取更多利益。特朗普总统已威逼盟友承诺在美进行巨额投资。在韩国——他的目标之一——内部人士担心政治反弹。他们说，新的美国工厂可能让韩国车企获利，但韩国民众需要看到国家能获得实实在在的利益。

This is a tricky moment for big businesses to navigate. The nationality of a global firm is becoming more important but more ambiguous. Political trust is in short supply. Public opinion can tolerate a single country dominating ping-pong, it turns out. Consent for globalisation requires wins to be shared more evenly. ■
对于大企业来说，这是一个难以驾驭的微妙时刻。全球公司的国籍正变得更加重要，但也更加模糊。政治信任严重短缺。事实证明，公众舆论可以容忍单一国家统治乒乓球赛场，但全球化的延续需要让共赢变得更加均衡。
