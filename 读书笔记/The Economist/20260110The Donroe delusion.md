## In Donald Trump’s world, the strong take what they can

That will be bad for America—and everyone else

FOR 12 years Nicolás Maduro terrorised Venezuela. He stole elections and, when people objected, his goons killed, raped or tortured them by suffocation with plastic bags. His comrades looted and mismanaged the economy so wantonly that GDP fell by 69%. A quarter of the population fled abroad. Both the economic collapse and the exodus have been worse than is typical during the bloodiest of civil wars.

Mr Maduro was also an international menace: colluding with drug gangs, threatening oil-rich Guyana and propping up Cuba’s communist tyranny with cheap fuel. He supported Hizbullah, helped Iran evade sanctions and gave Russia and China a foothold across the water from Florida. And then he was gone—snatched by US special forces on January 3rd.

This raid matters far beyond Venezuela. One reason is how it happened. It was a stunning display of hard power—and its limits. Another is why it happened. Rather than citing democracy or human rights, as American presidents once did, Donald Trump said he aimed to grab Venezuela’s oil and assert dominance over the western hemisphere. And a third is when it happened. Mr Trump is hastening the demise of the old order of UN resolutions, international law and universal values. The unfolding drama will help determine what takes its place.

First, consider the how. No other military force could have swooped in and seized a despot (and his wife) so surgically. It took less than three hours. Not a single American died, though a reported 32 Cuban spooks guarding the Maduros did. By January 5th the odious couple were in court in New York, facing drug charges and possibly life sentences. America’s adversaries have been warned.

Yet the story also illustrates the limits to military power. This was a raid, not an invasion. Scarred by failures in Afghanistan and Iraq, America is attempting, from afar, something much less than regime change. Mr Maduro is gone but his machinery of plunder and repression remains. His vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, seems to have taken charge. The regime’s motorbike militias, the colectivos, are on the streets reasserting terror. With many gun-toting groups in Venezuela, an army with 2,400 generals and much paranoia at the top, a descent into conflict is also possible.

Mr Trump says he now “runs” Venezuela, by which he means that Ms Rodríguez has to do what he says—or else. Yet he will struggle to enforce his will. True, the US Navy still blocks the oil exports on which Venezuela depends. On January 7th American forces seized two tankers used to ship Venezuelan oil, one near Iceland and one in the Caribbean. But Mr Trump’s threats to station troops in Venezuela or to launch repeated raids, each months in the planning, are not credible.

The second lesson from Venezuela is the why. The snatching of Mr Maduro is a worked example of the “Donroe doctrine”—Mr Trump’s vision of how America should assert itself in its region. “American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again,” he crowed. “Won’t happen.”

The doctrine is about power and natural resources, not values. Venezuela’s most popular politician is a democrat: the Nobel-prizewinning María Corina Machado. Mr Trump dismissed her as lacking “support”. Yet she is so popular that Mr Maduro barred her from the presidential election he stole in 2024. Mr Trump means she does not control the army. He prefers to back the people with guns instead. They have no interest in fair elections, which would mean losing power and risking jail. Venezuelans still hope Mr Trump can broker a transition to democracy, but he shows little inclination to try.

His national-security strategy, published in late 2025, spoke of enlisting friends and expanding alliances in the Americas. It is now clear that this invitation comes at the barrel of a gun. Within hours of announcing Mr Maduro’s capture, Mr Trump had also threatened Colombia, Cuba, Greenland and Mexico.

He makes clear he craves natural resources—mostly for America. Mr Trump has laid claim to Venezuela’s underexploited oil reserves—the world’s largest—and says that the United States will receive 30m-50m barrels straight away. Venezuela’s oil industry has been so badly managed that, with American help, raising output by a little should be possible. Yet Mr Trump’s boast that he can rapidly and profitably restore production to previous levels is deluded. Demand is weak and the country is short of skills and capital. And oil companies are wary of taking costly, decades-long, multi-billion-dollar bets that Venezuela will be safe.

Third is what this means for the Americas and the world. Smaller countries close to the United States may feel they have no choice but to submit to Mr Trump’s bullying. Yet in the years to come, many leaders will seek to reclaim their sovereignty. And many countries will quietly seek closer ties with other powers, including China. Unless coercion is balanced by attraction, Mr Trump’s hemispheric doctrine will eventually fail and, in doing so, weaken the United States.

In stating so brazenly that might makes right, Mr Trump has already undermined America’s alliances. Greenland is a self-governing part of Denmark, which is a member of NATO. Seizing it would destroy the alliance. America’s Pacific allies will also conclude that to depend on Mr Trump is to be vulnerable to his predations.

By contrast, China and Russia are experts in navigating a world where the strong impose their will on the weak. Mr Trump may believe that each will stick to its own sphere of influence, but where do those spheres begin and end? As countries everywhere feel emboldened to encroach on their neighbours, the dismal prospect is of an aggressive, border-shifting 19th-century world, but armed with 21st-century weapons.

America was a successful superpower because its self-interest and realpolitik were turbocharged by an avowed faith in universal values of democracy and human rights. Mr Trump believes that, far from being a unique strength in foreign affairs, that was a foolish indulgence. His raid on Venezuela is likely to show how wrong he is. ■

# In Donald Trump’s world, the strong take what they can

## 英文原文 + 中文翻译

### English Title
In Donald Trump’s world, the strong take what they can  
That will be bad for America—and everyone else

### 中文标题
在唐纳德·特朗普的世界里，强者予取予求  
这将对美国——以及其他所有人不利

### English Paragraph 1
FOR 12 years Nicolás Maduro terrorised Venezuela. He stole elections and, when people objected, his goons killed, raped or tortured them by suffocation with plastic bags. His comrades looted and mismanaged the economy so wantonly that GDP fell by 69%. A quarter of the population fled abroad. Both the economic collapse and the exodus have been worse than is typical during the bloodiest of civil wars.

### 中文段落 1
尼古拉斯·马杜罗在12年里恐吓委内瑞拉。他窃取选举，当人们反对时，他的爪牙通过用塑料袋窒息的方式杀害、强奸或折磨他们。他的同志们肆无忌惮地掠夺和失管经济，导致GDP下降了69%。四分之一的人口逃往国外。经济崩溃和人口外流都比最血腥的内战时期更糟糕。

### English Paragraph 2
Mr Maduro was also an international menace: colluding with drug gangs, threatening oil-rich Guyana and propping up Cuba’s communist tyranny with cheap fuel. He supported Hizbullah, helped Iran evade sanctions and gave Russia and China a foothold across the water from Florida. And then he was gone—snatched by US special forces on January 3rd.

### 中文段落 2
马杜罗还是国际威胁：与贩毒团伙勾结，威胁石油资源丰富的圭亚那，并用廉价燃料支撑古巴的共产主义暴政。他支持真主党，帮助伊朗规避制裁，并让俄罗斯和中国在佛罗里达对岸获得立足点。然后他就消失了——于1月3日被美国特种部队抓获。

### English Paragraph 3
This raid matters far beyond Venezuela. One reason is how it happened. It was a stunning display of hard power—and its limits. Another is why it happened. Rather than citing democracy or human rights, as American presidents once did, Donald Trump said he aimed to grab Venezuela’s oil and assert dominance over the western hemisphere. And a third is when it happened. Mr Trump is hastening the demise of the old order of UN resolutions, international law and universal values. The unfolding drama will help determine what takes its place.

### 中文段落 3
这次突袭的影响远超委内瑞拉。一个原因是它如何发生。这是硬实力的惊人展示——及其局限性。另一个原因是它为什么发生。唐纳德·特朗普不像以往的美国总统那样引用民主或人权，而是说他旨在抢夺委内瑞拉的石油并确立对西半球的主导地位。第三个原因是它何时发生。特朗普先生正在加速联合国决议、国际法和普世价值的旧秩序的消亡。正在展开的戏剧将有助于决定什么将取而代之。

### English Paragraph 4
First, consider the how. No other military force could have swooped in and seized a despot (and his wife) so surgically. It took less than three hours. Not a single American died, though a reported 32 Cuban spooks guarding the Maduros did. By January 5th the odious couple were in court in New York, facing drug charges and possibly life sentences. America’s adversaries have been warned.

### 中文段落 4
首先，考虑如何发生。没有其他军事力量能够如此精准地突袭并抓获一个独裁者（及其妻子）。这花了不到三个小时。没有一名美国人死亡，尽管据报道有32名保护马杜罗夫妇的古巴间谍丧生。到1月5日，这对可憎的夫妇已在纽约出庭，面临毒品指控，可能被判无期徒刑。美国的对手们已被警告。

### English Paragraph 5
Yet the story also illustrates the limits to military power. This was a raid, not an invasion. Scarred by failures in Afghanistan and Iraq, America is attempting, from afar, something much less than regime change. Mr Maduro is gone but his machinery of plunder and repression remains. His vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, seems to have taken charge. The regime’s motorbike militias, the colectivos, are on the streets reasserting terror. With many gun-toting groups in Venezuela, an army with 2,400 generals and much paranoia at the top, a descent into conflict is also possible.

### 中文段落 5
然而，这个故事也说明了军事力量的局限性。这是一次突袭，而不是入侵。由于在阿富汗和伊拉克的失败，美国正在从远处尝试远低于政权更迭的事情。马杜罗走了，但他的掠夺和镇压机器依然存在。他的副总统德尔西·罗德里格斯似乎已接管。政权下的摩托车民兵团体colectivos在街上重新施加恐怖。在委内瑞拉，有许多持枪团体，一支拥有2400名将军的军队，以及高层的高度偏执，陷入冲突也是可能的。

### English Paragraph 6
Mr Trump says he now “runs” Venezuela, by which he means that Ms Rodríguez has to do what he says—or else. Yet he will struggle to enforce his will. True, the US Navy still blocks the oil exports on which Venezuela depends. On January 7th American forces seized two tankers used to ship Venezuelan oil, one near Iceland and one in the Caribbean. But Mr Trump’s threats to station troops in Venezuela or to launch repeated raids, each months in the planning, are not credible.

### 中文段落 6
特朗普先生说他现在“掌控”委内瑞拉，他意思是罗德里格斯女士必须按他说的做——否则后果自负。然而，他将难以强制执行他的意志。诚然，美国海军仍在封锁委内瑞拉依赖的石油出口。1月7日，美国军队扣押了两艘用于运送委内瑞拉石油的油轮，一艘在冰岛附近，一艘在加勒比海。但特朗普先生威胁在委内瑞拉驻军或发动多次突袭（每次都需要数月规划）并不可信。

### English Paragraph 7
The second lesson from Venezuela is the why. The snatching of Mr Maduro is a worked example of the “Donroe doctrine”—Mr Trump’s vision of how America should assert itself in its region. “American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again,” he crowed. “Won’t happen.”

### 中文段落 7
从委内瑞拉得出的第二个教训是为什么。抓获马杜罗是“唐罗主义”的一个实际例子——特朗普先生对美国如何在其地区确立自身地位的愿景。“美国在西半球的主导地位将永远不会再被质疑，”他得意洋洋地说。“不会发生。”

### English Paragraph 8
The doctrine is about power and natural resources, not values. Venezuela’s most popular politician is a democrat: the Nobel-prizewinning María Corina Machado. Mr Trump dismissed her as lacking “support”. Yet she is so popular that Mr Maduro barred her from the presidential election he stole in 2024. Mr Trump means she does not control the army. He prefers to back the people with guns instead. They have no interest in fair elections, which would mean losing power and risking jail. Venezuelans still hope Mr Trump can broker a transition to democracy, but he shows little inclination to try.

### 中文段落 8
这个主义关乎权力和自然资源，而不是价值观。委内瑞拉最受欢迎的政治人物是一位民主人士：诺贝尔奖得主玛丽亚·科里纳·马查多。特朗普先生斥她缺乏“支持”。然而，她如此受欢迎，以至于马杜罗在2024年窃取的总统选举中禁止她参选。特朗普先生意思是她不控制军队。他更喜欢支持持枪的人。他们对公平选举没有兴趣，因为那意味着失去权力并面临入狱风险。委内瑞拉人仍希望特朗普先生能促成向民主的过渡，但他显示出很少尝试的倾向。

### English Paragraph 9
His national-security strategy, published in late 2025, spoke of enlisting friends and expanding alliances in the Americas. It is now clear that this invitation comes at the barrel of a gun. Within hours of announcing Mr Maduro’s capture, Mr Trump had also threatened Colombia, Cuba, Greenland and Mexico.

### 中文段落 9
他于2025年底发布的国家安全战略谈到在美洲招募朋友并扩大联盟。现在清楚的是，这种邀请是在枪口下发出的。在宣布抓获马杜罗的数小时内，特朗普先生还威胁了哥伦比亚、古巴、格陵兰和墨西哥。

### English Paragraph 10
He makes clear he craves natural resources—mostly for America. Mr Trump has laid claim to Venezuela’s underexploited oil reserves—the world’s largest—and says that the United States will receive 30m-50m barrels straight away. Venezuela’s oil industry has been so badly managed that, with American help, raising output by a little should be possible. Yet Mr Trump’s boast that he can rapidly and profitably restore production to previous levels is deluded. Demand is weak and the country is short of skills and capital. And oil companies are wary of taking costly, decades-long, multi-billion-dollar bets that Venezuela will be safe.

### 中文段落 10
他明确表示渴望自然资源——主要是为美国。特朗普先生声称拥有委内瑞拉未充分利用的石油储备——世界上最大的——并说美国将立即收到3000万至5000万桶。委内瑞拉的石油工业管理如此糟糕，在美国的帮助下，略微提高产量应该是可能的。然而，特朗普先生吹嘘他能迅速且盈利地将产量恢复到以前水平的说法是妄想的。需求疲软，国家缺乏技能和资本。而且石油公司对在委内瑞拉进行昂贵、持续数十年的数十亿美元赌注持谨慎态度，认为那里是否安全。

### English Paragraph 11
Third is what this means for the Americas and the world. Smaller countries close to the United States may feel they have no choice but to submit to Mr Trump’s bullying. Yet in the years to come, many leaders will seek to reclaim their sovereignty. And many countries will quietly seek closer ties with other powers, including China. Unless coercion is balanced by attraction, Mr Trump’s hemispheric doctrine will eventually fail and, in doing so, weaken the United States.

### 中文段落 11
第三个是这对美洲和世界意味着什么。靠近美国的较小国家可能觉得别无选择，只能屈从于特朗普先生的霸凌。然而在未来的岁月里，许多领导人将寻求收回他们的主权。而且许多国家将悄悄寻求与其他大国，包括中国的更紧密联系。除非胁迫与吸引力平衡，否则特朗普先生的半球主义最终将失败，并在失败中削弱美国。

### English Paragraph 12
In stating so brazenly that might makes right, Mr Trump has already undermined America’s alliances. Greenland is a self-governing part of Denmark, which is a member of NATO. Seizing it would destroy the alliance. America’s Pacific allies will also conclude that to depend on Mr Trump is to be vulnerable to his predations.

### 中文段落 12
在如此厚颜无耻地宣称强权即公理时，特朗普先生已经破坏了美国的联盟。格陵兰是丹麦自治的一部分，丹麦是北约成员。夺取它将摧毁联盟。美国的太平洋盟友也将得出结论，依赖特朗普先生就是容易受到他的掠夺。

### English Paragraph 13
By contrast, China and Russia are experts in navigating a world where the strong impose their will on the weak. Mr Trump may believe that each will stick to its own sphere of influence, but where do those spheres begin and end? As countries everywhere feel emboldened to encroach on their neighbours, the dismal prospect is of an aggressive, border-shifting 19th-century world, but armed with 21st-century weapons.

### 中文段落 13
相比之下，中国和俄罗斯是驾驭这样一个世界的专家，在这个世界里，强者将意志强加于弱者。特朗普先生可能相信每个人都会坚守自己的势力范围，但这些范围从哪里开始和结束？随着各国到处感到胆大妄为地侵犯邻国，黯淡的前景是一个侵略性的、边界变动的19世纪世界，但装备了21世纪的武器。

### English Paragraph 14
America was a successful superpower because its self-interest and realpolitik were turbocharged by an avowed faith in universal values of democracy and human rights. Mr Trump believes that, far from being a unique strength in foreign affairs, that was a foolish indulgence. His raid on Venezuela is likely to show how wrong he is. ■

### 中文段落 14
美国是一个成功的超级大国，因为它的自身利益和现实政治被公开信仰民主和人权的普世价值所涡轮增压。特朗普先生相信，那远非外交事务中的独特优势，而是一种愚蠢的放纵。他对委内瑞拉的突袭很可能显示他多么错误。■
